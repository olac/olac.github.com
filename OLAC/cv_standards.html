<h2>
<A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The OLAC metadata set [<a href="#OLAC-MS">OLAC-MS</a>] uses approximately a dozen
        controlled vocabularies to enumerate possible element refinements and possible
        coded values for elements. This document lists the community's requirements
        with respect to the use of controlled vocabularies, and then describes
        standards for documenting, distributing, and managing controlled vocabularies
        in such a way as to meet those requirements.</p>
<h2>
<A name="Requirements"></A>2. Requirements</h2>
<p>There are three main uses of controlled vocabularies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users consult them in order to select the right term for a
            particular purpose, such as when specifying search terms or when creating the
            metadata for a resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated processes consult them in order to verify the validity
            of metadata that use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data providers and service providers consult them (when new
            versions of controlled vocabularies are released) in order to discover what has
            changed and thus to learn what may need to change in existing metadata or
            services. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the standpoint of selecting the right term, these are the main
        requirements on a controlled vocabulary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There needs to be a standard coded value for each term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the coded value for a term is too cryptic to stand on its own
            in a user interface, users also need to be able to see and choose from brief
            descriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the brief description is not enough to clarify what the term
            represents, users also need to be able to consult an extended definition (often
            including examples).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the standpoint of validating coded data, there is just one basic
        requirement:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>There needs to be a complete list of the standard coded values for
            all the terms in a vocabulary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the standpoint of keeping coded data up-to-date with the latest
        version of a controlled vocabulary, these are the main requirements for dealing
        with changes to the controlled vocabulary:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Persons who use the controlled vocabulary to assign coded values
            in metadata records need to be able to get a list of all changes to it (such as
            additions, deletions, shifts in meaning) so that they can learn what needs to
            change in their coding practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data providers need an automated way to find all the metadata
            records that may may no longer be correctly coded (such as when codes are
            retired or shift in their range of meaning). For each affected coded value,
            there should be an indication of how existing data may need to be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data providers need for the activity of updating existing data to
            be an infrequent one. Thus changes to controlled vocabularies need to be
            gathered up into infrequent version releases, rather than being made whenever a
            change is decided upon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining sections describe a set of standards for managing
        controlled vocabularies that are designed to meet the above requirements. These
        standards are followed within OLAC so as to ensure that the requirements are
        met in a consistent way for all OLAC controlled vocabularies.</p>
<h2>
<A name="Documenting controlled vocabularies"></A>3. Documenting controlled vocabularies</h2>
<p>Any controlled vocabulary used by the OLAC metadata set
        [<a href="#OLAC-MS">OLAC-MS</a>] must be explained in a document that is publicly accessible
        over the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Such a document will typically give an overview of what the vocabulary
        is used for and how it is organized, and then give a complete listing of the
        terms in the vocabulary with definitions and even examples. It should also
        document what has changed in the controlled vocabulary whenever a new version
        is released. </p>
<p>The documentation of the individual terms need not be in the overall
        document; it could, for instance, be stored in a database with a CGI interface.
        When the terms are not defined in the controlled vocabulary document, it is
        required that each term have a unique URL by means of which its definition can
        be retrieved. In the case of vocabulary terms defined in the overall controlled
        vocabulary document, it is recommended best practice to offer direct access to
        individual terms by means of named anchors in an HTML document.</p>
<p>A separate implementation note [<a href="#CV-Impl">CV-Impl</a>] describes an XML
        application for documenting and distributing controlled vocabularies in
        conformance to this standard.</p>
<h2>
<A name="Distributing controlled vocabularies"></A>4. Distributing controlled vocabularies </h2>
<p>Every controlled vocabulary used in the OLAC metadata set
        [<a href="#OLAC-MS">OLAC-MS</a>] is distributed in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as an XML schema fragment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a pair of tables that can be loaded into a database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The schema for the OLAC metadata set has an <tt>&lt;include&gt;</tt>
        directive for each of the controlled vocabularies it uses. The following, for
        instance, is the content of the file which holds the schema fragment for the
        Dublin Core Type vocabulary [<a href="#DC-Type">DC-Type</a>]:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">&lt;schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:olac="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.3/"
        targetNamespace="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.3/"
        elementFormDefault="qualified"
        attributeFormDefault="unqualified"&gt;

  &lt;annotation&gt;
    &lt;documentation&gt;
      OLAC Schema for DC types, Steven Bird, 5/7/01
    &lt;/documentation&gt;
  &lt;/annotation&gt;

  &lt;simpleType name="DC-Type-Code"&gt;
    &lt;restriction base="string"&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Collection"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Dataset"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Event"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Image"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Interactive Resource"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Service"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Software"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Sound"/&gt;
      &lt;enumeration value="Text"/&gt;
    &lt;/restriction&gt;
  &lt;/simpleType&gt;

&lt;/schema&gt;
</pre>
<p>The purpose of this file is to enumerate all the possible coded values
        in the controlled vocabulary so that schema validation software can ensure that
        the values provided in OLAC metadata records are valid. </p>
<p>OLAC data providers (at least the larger ones) typically use
        relational database technology to build and maintain the catalog of their
        holdings; this database then serves as the source of the OLAC metadata records.
        For these providers, selection, validation, and maintenance of coded values
        needs to take place in the database. In order to support these data providers,
        every OLAC controlled vocabulary is also made available in a pair of text files
        that can be loaded as tables into a relational database. They are in
        tab-delimited format; that is, each row is on a separate line and a tab
        character separates the columns. </p>
<p>The first file is the code table itself. There is one row for each
        term in the controlled vocabulary. Each row has three columns: one for the
        coded value, another to give a label or brief description that can be used in a
        user interface, and a third to give the URL that will retrieve the detailed
        definition of that term. For instance, the first seven rows of the code table
        for the OLAC-Language controlled vocabulary [<a href="#OLAC-Language">OLAC-Language</a>] is as
        follows:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">x-sil-AAA   Ghotuo      http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAA
x-sil-AAB   Arum-tesu   http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAB
x-sil-AAC   Ari         http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAC
x-sil-AAD   Amal        http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAD
x-sil-AAE   Albanian, Arbereshe   http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAE
x-sil-AAF   Aranadan    http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAF
x-sil-AAG   Are         http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAG
</pre>
<p>The second file is a change history table. Three kinds of changes are
        tracked: new codes that are added to the vocabulary, codes that change in
        meaning, and codes that are retired from the vocabulary. There is one row for
        every change to the controlled vocabulary. Each row has four columns: the code
        that is affected, the date the change was effective, a one-letter code to
        represent which of the three kinds of change is involved, and a bit of text
        describing what needs to be done in order to update existing data. By
        performing a SQL JOIN between a coded column in the data provider's database
        and the code column of the change history table, a data provider may
        automatically detect all database records that may need to be updated. </p>
<p>In summary, the structure of the two tables is as follows:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">CODE TABLE
   Code         -- The standardized form of the term
   Description  -- Brief description of what it represents
   URL          -- URL for retrieving detailed definition

CHANGE HISTORY TABLE
   Code         -- A code that is different
   Date         -- The date of the change
   Action       -- N(ew), C(hanged), R(etired)
   Remedy       -- Description of how to update existing data
</pre>
<p>The code table always holds the most current version of the complete
        set of coded values. The change history table always holds the complete history
        of all changes. That is, rows are never removed from the table; they are only
        added as codes change. </p>
<h2>
<A name="File naming conventions"></A>5. File naming conventions</h2>
<p>All files relating to controlled vocabularies are named following the
        same conventions. All such file names are formed from a hyphenated
        <i>basename</i> that identifies the promulgating authority and the topic of the
        vocabulary, for instance, <i>DC-Type</i> and <i>OLAC-Language</i>. Apart from
        the hyphen, the basename contains only alphabetic characters.</p>
<p>The official version of all controlled vocabulary files is to be found
        on the OLAC web site (<tt>http://www.language-archives.org</tt>). They are to
        be found with the following names and locations:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">/OLAC/basename.html             -- Documentation
/OLAC/src/basename.xsd          -- XML schema fragment
/OLAC/src/basename.tab          -- tab-delimited code table
/OLAC/src/basename-Changes.tab  -- change history table</pre>
<h2>
<A name="Managing controlled vocabularies"></A>6. Managing controlled vocabularies</h2>
<p>Once a controlled vocabulary goes into service, it needs to be as
        stable as possible. Thus, the OLAC Coordinators are to observe the following
        constraints on updates to the controlled vocabularies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Updates to the documents or data files that clarify definitions or
            explanations may be made at any time without requiring community review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates that add codes, change what codes mean, or retire codes
            must be run through the OLAC document process [<a href="#OLAC-Process">OLAC-Process</a>] as a
            proposed revision to a standard. Thus the revisions to the vocabulary must be
            reviewed and approved by the group of Participating Archives and Services.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<font color="red">To do</font>
</h2>
<font color="red">
<p>Section 3. Require a document on our site? I didn't, thinking of DC-Type
      and elements of DC-Q that are documented on the DCMI site. However, I'm
      starting to think that we might need a document on our site in all cases (which
      can then point to another document for its guts) that would offer links to the
      xsd and two tab files, and that would give the column declarations for the tab
      files (e.g. tell how wide to declare the columns). Anything else needed in the
      document?</p>
<p>Section 5. I don't have the subdirectories right. What did we decide for
      these? And what about versions of schema fragments and code tables? By
      following our document standards, we will keep old versions of the document. Do
      we also keep old versions of the schema fragment and the code tables? Note that
      the change history table gives us complete version history.</p>
<p>Section 6. We need to figure out how to handle forks in the version tree
      when there is an adopted version that is already in use, and a proposed
      revision is going through the document process with the aim of superseding the
      current version. The obvious options are to either put the proposed set of four
      files (without changing their names) in a folder for pending revisions, or to
      leave them in the same folder but add a suffix to the basename like -REV.</p>
