
NOTES ON UPGRADING FROM OLAC 1.0 to 1.1

G. Simons, 26 Jan 2008

We will need a proper document to give people guidance. This file just contains notes about waht that document needs to contain.

In <Repository> for a static repository, change
xmlns:olac="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/" to 1.1
Also in <olac-archive>
Twice in the <oai:metadataFormat> description

In the schemaLocation attribute there are three instance of 1.0 to change to 1.1.



THINGS TO FIX TO FINALIZE the SCHEMAS

The svn repository schemaLocation is multiple times in:
    static-repository.xml
    OLAC-PMH.xsd
    static-repository.xsd
