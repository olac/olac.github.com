<h2><b>Registering as an OLAC Data Provider</b> </h2>
  
<p>Data providers who support the OLAC protocol are encouraged to list their 
repository in the OLAC registry.&nbsp; The goals of the registry are:</p>
 
<ul>
 <li>Provide a publicly accessible list of OLAC conformant repositories,
making it easy for service providers to discover repositories from which
metadata about language-related resources can be harvested. </li>
 <li>Provide a mechanism for data providers to ensure their conformance with
the OLAC protocol specification, and evaluate their degree of compliance
with OLAC recommended best practices. </li>
 <li>Provide a basis for participating in the governance of OLAC in the role
of "participating archive". </li>
 
</ul>
 
<p>This page allows you to register your repository by entering your <a
 href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm#HTTPRequestFormat"><font
 face="Courier">BASE-URL</font></a> in the text box at the bottom of this 
page.&nbsp; <i>Before</i> doing that, please read all of this instruction
page so you understand what registration means.</p>

<h2><a name="consequences"></a>Consequences of Registration</h2>
  
<p>By registering your repository you agree to the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
<ul>
 <li>OLAC will immediately run a set of conformance tests on your repository.&nbsp;
To ensure integrity of the registry, we will only register those repositories
that complete these tests.&nbsp; An email confirming the results of the conformance
test will be sent to the address specified in the <font face="Courier">adminEmail</font>
element returned via the <a
 href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Identify"><font
 face="Courier">Identify</font></a> protocol request. </li>
 <li>OLAC will periodically retest your repository for conformance.&nbsp;
In the case that your repository fails to complete the tests, we will remove
your repository from the registry and send an email with information to help
you return to conformance.</li>
 <li>OLAC will periodically harvest all the metadata from your repository
in order to evaluate it for compliance with OLAC's best practice recommendations. 
A report documenting extent of compliance will be posted for access by the 
community. Non-compliance to recommended best practice will not be a grounds 
for removal from the registry</li>
 <li>OLAC will offer members of the end-user community the opportunity to
write peer reviews of your archive. When your archive is reviewed, you will
be given a chance to write a response that will be posted with the review.</li>
 <li>The registry database will store the information returned via the <font
 face="Bell MT"><a
 href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Identify">Identify</a></font> 
protocol request. Contents of the registration database are open for public 
searching and browsing.</li>
 <li> Your repository will be listed on the OLAC server, in both <a
 href="/community.php4">human-readable</a>
and <a
 href="/register/archive_list.php">machine-readable</a>
form. You agree that any potential service provider is authorized to harvest
and redistribute metadata from your repository using this base URL.</li>
 <li>Your archive will be considered to be a participating archive and will
be allowed to participate in the governance of OLAC as described in the <a
 href="/OLAC/process.html">OLAC process document</a>.</li>
 
</ul>


<h2><a name="register"></a>Register Your Repository</h2>

<p>You can register your OLAC repository using our <a
href="/register/register.php">registration interface</a>.
Your repository is validated first.
Once it is successfully validated, you will be invited to submit a registration
request by clicking on the "REGISTER" button.  If you click on the button,
the request is forwarded to OLAC Coordinators.</p>


<h2><a name="confirmation"></a>Confirmation of Registration</h2>
  
<p>Once a registration request is submitted,
it is forwarded to the OLAC Coordinators
who will check that the archive is relevant to language resources before
adding it to the&nbsp;<a
 href="/register/archive_list.php"> List
of Registered OLAC Archives</a>. </p>
