<h2>
<A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This document provides guidelines on how to describe language resources using the OLAC metadata standard
               [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html">OLAC-Metadata</a>]. The standard itself documents the formal syntax of valid metadata records, but
            does not explain or exemplify the use of the individual metadata elements. That is the purpose of this
            document. </p>
<p>Section 2 below describes the usage of the attributes that may be used on metadata elements. Section 3 then
            describes usage in the OLAC context for the fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set. Section 4
            describes other elements that may be used. Section 5 concludes with remarks about the granularity of
            resources; that is, it addresses the question of what size of thing (from file up to entire corpus) is
            treated as an item in an OLAC repository.</p>
<h2>
<A name="All elements"></A>2. All elements</h2>
<p>OLAC metadata is an application of the Dublin Core metadata element set as defined in [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>]. The
            most fundamental requirement on best practice in OLAC is that each element should be used in a way that
            conforms to its definition in [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>]. This document therefore repeats those definitions and offers
            usage notes and examples to help the reader understand best use of the elements in the context of describing
            language resources.</p>
<p>Eight of the elements in the Dublin Core metadata set define refinements that narrow the meaning of the
            element. A refinement shares the meaning of the generic element, but with a more restricted scope. When the
            more restricted meaning applies, it is recommended best practice to use the refined version of an element
            rather than the generic one. This document lists the refinements that are possible for each element.</p>
<p>In theory, every element in the metadata set may use the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute to specify an encoding
            scheme that defines a controlled vocabulary or a controlled syntax for its values. This document lists
            possible encoding schemes for eleven of the elements, whether defined by [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>] or
               [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/olac-extensions.html">OLAC-Extensions</a>]. In the case of the OLAC extensions, the controlled value goes in the
               <i>olac:code</i> attribute (with the element content being available for an optional freeform elaboration
            of the coded value), while in the case of DCMI encoding schemes the controlled value goes in the element
            content. When one of these encoding schemes is applicable, it is recommended best practice to use it since
            this adds precision to the value of the element that can be exploited to improve accuracy in searching and
            to provide domain-specific services. Subcommunities may follow the extension mechanism defined in section 5
            of [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html">OLAC-Metadata</a>] to define new encoding schemes.</p>
<p>Every element in the metadata set may use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute. It specifies the language in which
            the text within the content of the metadata element is written. Though the [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag">XML-Lang</a>] specification
            permits a wider range of values for this attribute, it is recommended for purposes of interoperation in the
            OLAC context that only identifiers that conform to the [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>] specification be used. The
            OLAC harvester normalizes values of <i>xml:lang</i> in the way described in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>]. In the
            absence of an <i>xml:lang</i> attribute, the element content is assumed to be in English (unless it is a
            coded value from an encoding scheme). Whenever the language of the element content is other than English,
            recommended best practice is to use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute to identify the language. By using
            multiple instances of a metadata elements tagged for different languages, data providers may offer their
            metadata records in multiple languages. The use of the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute as the language of the
            metadata should not be confused with the use of the <i>olac:language</i> scheme with <a href="#Language">Language</a>
            and <a href="#Subject">Subject</a> to specify, respectively, the content language of the resource itself and the
            subject of the resource. In fact, the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute may be used within these elements, as well,
            to specify an alternative name of the identified language, given in the language specified in
            <i>xml:lang</i> (see <a href="#Language">Language</a> for an example).</p>
<p>In the formal definition of the metadata standard [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html">OLAC-Metadata</a>], every element and refinement is
            optional and repeatable. However, recommended best practice (as described below for particular elements and
            in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/bpr.html">OLAC-BP</a>]) requires that certain elements be present in order to give a basic breadth of
            description for a language resource. Recommended best practice also requires that one particular element
            (namely, <a href="#Title">Title</a>) not be repeated. Since all other elements and refinements are repeatable,
            multiple values for an element or refinement should be given in multiple instances of the XML element rather
            than being listed in a single instance. This makes it possible for service providers to build search indexes
            on the individual values.</p>
<p>To summarize, the following are recommended best practices that apply to all elements:</p>
<table align="center" cellspacing="12" width="95%">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="100"><i>Best&nbsp;practice&nbsp;</i></td><td>
<p>Recommended best practice is for the value of each metadata element to conform to the definition of
                  that element as given in [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>].</p>
<p>When the meaning of a particular element in a metadata record fits the definition of a refinement,
                  recommended best practice is to use the refinement rather than the generic element.</p>
<p>When applicable, recommended best practice is to use the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute to specify an
                  encoding scheme so as to express the value of the element with precision.</p>
<p>Whenever the language of the element content is other than English, recommended best practice is to
                  use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute with a value from [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>] to identify the language.</p>
<p>When a resource has more than one value for a particular metadata element or refinement, recommended
                  best practice is to use a separate instance of the element or refinement for each value rather than
                  listing all the values in a single instance.</p>

<h2>
<A name="Core elements"></A>3. Core elements</h2>
<p>Each of the fifteen core elements of the Dublin Core metadata set is described in one of the following
            subsections. These elements are defined in the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</a> namespace for
            which the prefix <tt>dc:</tt> is used in the examples.</p>
<p>Each subsection heading gives the name of an element; the element is then described under six subheadings.
               <i>Definition</i> is the definition for the element as given by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
               [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>]. <i>Refinements</i> lists the refined element names that may be used in place of the
            generic element name to specify a more precise meaning for the metadata item. The refinement definitions are
            copied from [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>]. All of the refinements are defined within the
            <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a> namespace for which the prefix <tt>dcterms:</tt> is used in the
            examples. <i>Schemes</i> lists the encoding schemes that may be used with the element (or its refinements)
            as the value of the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute. <i>Best practice</i> lists the best practices for the use of
            the element that are recommended by the OLAC community [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/bpr.html">OLAC-BP</a>]. <i>Usage notes</i> offers
            additional notes for the OLAC community on how to use the element in the context of describing language
            resources. <i>Examples</i> shows samples of properly encoded elements and sample refinements.</p>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="100"><i>Usage&nbsp;notes&nbsp;</i></td><td>
<p>A Contributor may be a person, an organization, or a service&mdash;any entity that has sufficient
                  involvement in the creation or development of the resource to warrant explicit identification. A term
                  from <i>olac:role</i> should be used to specify the role of the Contributor. Contributor is related to
                     <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> since many of the terms in the role vocabulary (like <i>author</i> or
                     <i>photographer</i>) name the role of the primary creator of a resource. The OLAC recommendation is
                  that Contributor (with the appropriate role designation) be used in these cases, and that Creator be
                  used only when there is not an appropriate term in the <i>olac:role</i> vocabulary for the role played
                  by the entity that created the resource. A participating OLAC repository need not be concerned about
                  the fact that other metadata services based on Dublin Core may prefer and even require the use of the
                  Creator element. The OLAC-to-Simple-DC crosswalk built into the OLAC Aggregator automatically maps
                  certain OLAC Contributor roles like <i>author</i> and <i>photographer</i> to the Creator element. See
                  the discussion of <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> for more on its use.</p>
<p>Contributor and <a href="#Publisher">Publisher</a> are also somewhat related elements. In particular, the
                     <i>olac:role</i> &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; can come close to one aspect of participation that a publisher may have
                  in regard to making a given resource available to the public. The <i>olac:role</i> &ldquo;editor&rdquo; can
                  encompass a spectrum of tasks that are collectively performed by the publisher of a work. A sponsor or
                  editor that is not also the formal publisher of a resource may be entered in a Contributor element
                  (with the proper <i>olac:role</i> specified), but the publisher should not be repeated in a
                  Contributor element.</p>
<p>The form of a personal name should follow the form in which the person's name would normally be listed
                  in an alphabetical index in his or her own language or country of residence, <i>e.g.,</i> &ldquo;FamilyName,
                  GivenName&rdquo; for an English speaker. If the first element is the family name, follow the family name
                  with a comma. If the first element is the given name, do not follow it with a comma. Consult the
                  Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd ed., rev., [<a href="#AACR2r">AACR2r</a>] chapter 22 for additional guidance
                  in determining the normal ordering and forms of names based on language and country, as well as other
                  name characteristics.</p>
<p>The form of a corporate name (<i>e.g.,</i> name of an institution or organization or any other
                  corporate body) should also be ready for sorting in an alphabetical index. This means that an initial
                  article should be omitted. In cases where a hierarchy present, list the parts of the hierarchy from
                  largest to smallest, separated by period (full stop) and space. Location should generally be omitted
                  from the name unless location is an integral part of the proper name of the unit. Do not use quotation
                  marks to enclose corporate names. If the name is a translation from its usual form or is not usually
                  given in English, use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute on the element. More guidance on the forms of
                  corporate names may be found in [<a href="#AACR2r">AACR2r</a>], chapter 24.</p>
<p>In general, if there is no suitable role in the <i>olac:role</i> scheme, no additional information
                  regarding the particular role of the contributor should be included in content of the element, as this
                  would have the effect of making separate indexed forms for the same person based on engaging in
                  different kinds of contributory activities.</p>

<p>In the case of spatial coverage, recommended best

<p> Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal
                  period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).

<p>Coverage is related to <a href="#Subject">Subject</a> in having a topical orientation. Coverage in its temporal
                  aspect should not be confused with <a href="#Date">Date</a> or one of its refinements (<i>e.g.,</i> created,
                  or available). Thus, a data set that was compiled over an extended period of time should be described
                  via a <tt>dcterms:created</tt> element whose content is a date range, rather than with Coverage or
                     <tt>dcterms:temporal</tt>. A data set (or any kind of resource) that contains or addresses
                  historical information would correctly use Coverage or <tt>dcterms:temporal</tt> to specify the date,
                  date range or period in focus.</p>
<p>Coverage should be used geographically when the language variety in focus in the resource has a
                  different or narrower distribution than the language has in general. It should also be used when the
                  resource deals with a topic of study in which the location or region itself is in focus, <i>e.g.,</i>
                  multilingualism, language policy, languages in contact, in a given locale.</p>
<p>Geospatial coordinates are appropriate Coverage metadata for a text recording when they identify the
                  location where the exemplified speech variety is spoken. Typically this coincides with the location
                  where the text was collected, but not always. If the text was collected outside a community where it
                  is spoken (such as in a laboratory setting), then information about the circumstances of collection
                  would be included in the Description element. </p>

<p>A Creator may be a person, an organization, or a service. It refers to an entity with a primary role
                  in the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of the resource [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/library-application-profile/index.shtml#creator">DC-Lib</a>]. Creator is
                  closely related to <a href="#Contributor">Contributor</a>. The OLAC recommendation is that Creator be viewed
                  semantically as a <i>refinement</i> of Contributor, though it retains its status (and therefore its
                  syntax) as an element for backward compatibility. (This is in line with the latest recommendations of
                  the DCMI; see [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>] and [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/library-application-profile/index.shtml#creator">DC-Lib</a>].) Thus, Creator is appropriate to use in cases
                  where the entity to be identified has significant involvement as a primary originator of the content,
                  but in such a way that none of the role terms available in the <i>olac:role</i> scheme is a suitable
                  description of that involvement. Examples are <i>artist</i> (<i>e.g.,</i> sculptor, carver, weaver) or
                     <i>modeler</i>.</p>
<p>A participating OLAC repository need not be concerned about the fact that other metadata services
                  based on Dublin Core may prefer and even require the use of the Creator element. The OLAC-to-Simple-DC
                  crosswalk built into the OLAC Aggregator automatically maps certain OLAC Contributor roles like
                     <i>author</i> and <i>photographer</i> to the Creator element.</p>

<p>A WSCDTF-conformant value may be for the year alone, for the year and month, or for an exact date. A
                  range of years is also a valid value; in this case both years must be four-digit values and the
                  earliest year should come first. Thus, the element value may match one of the four following patterns:
                     <tt>YYYY</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM</tt>, <tt>YYYY-MM-DD</tt>, or <tt>YYYY-YYYY</tt>.</p>
<p>A Date with no refinement will be assumed to be the date of issue (<i>i.e.</i> publication). Date of
                  publication may differ from its creation date; thus it can be helpful to prospective users to include
                  more than one kind of Date element (refinement). However, a single resource should not have more than
                  one instance of each date refinement, with the possible exception of <tt>dcterms:modified</tt>. Where

<p>Recommended best practice is that every record contain at least one Language element. For a resource

                  for &ldquo;No linguistic content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recommended best practice is to use a value from the <i>olac:language</i> scheme with the Language element to

<p>Language is used for a language the resource is in, as opposed to the language it describes (see
                     <a href="#Subject">Subject</a>). When a resource is in more than one language, use a separate Language
                  element for each language.</p>
<p>Best practice is to specify a language code in the <i>olac:code</i> attribute. The element content is
                  typically left empty. When the controlled vocabulary does not offer an appropriate code, the element
                  content may be used to identify the language. It may be used in addition to the code to supply further
                  specificity, such as to give a note about the particular variety or to name a specific dialect.
                  Element content may also be used to give an alternate name that differs from the reference name given
                  by the controlled vocabulary or to give the name of the language in another language.</p>
<p>For a resource of a particular [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type.html">OLAC-Linguistic-Type</a>] (see <a href="#Type">Type</a>), the uses of
                  the Language element and the <a href="#Subject">Subject</a> element with the <i>olac:language</i> scheme
                  (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Subject.language&rdquo;) can be generally described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For linguistic type <i>primary_text:</i> use the Language element to specify the language of the
                        text. In addition, if it is annotated, use a second Language element to specify the language in
                        which the annotations are made, as well as a Subject.language element repeating the language of
                        the text, which is (in effect) the "subject" of the annotations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For linguistic type <i>lexicon:</i> use Language for the language in which the definitions are
                        written; use Subject.language for the language whose words are being defined. A bilingual
                        dictionary may have both languages identified in both kinds of elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For linguistic type <i>language_description:</i> use Language for the language the description
                        is written in, and use Subject.language to specify the language being described. In addition, if
                        the resource contains fairly extensive examples in the language being described (<i>e.g.,</i>
                        many sentence-length examples as might be the case in an extensive grammatical description), it
                        is appropriate to add a Language element for the language being described in order to convey the
                        presence of content in that language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a work of literature or other monolingual document aimed at the speakers of a particular language,
                  use Language to identify that language. For a sound recording, use Language for the language being
                  spoken in the recording.</p>
<p>Service providers should use the <i>code</i> attribute to support searches by language, and may use
                  the element content in searches by keyword. They also may supply the default language name in keyword
                  searching when the element content is missing.</p>

<p>Examples of a Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a
                  Publisher should be used to indicate the entity. [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>] The Publisher is generally the
                  business, organization, or sometimes individual who takes responsibility (and provides financial and
                  production resources) for putting the resource into a form suitable for making it publicly available,
                  whether in multiple hard copies (printing, pressing of a disc, etc), by broadcasting (radio,
                  television, webcast), or posting to a public website. A published resource may be offered for sale or
                  freely, but in either case, it is released for public use. </p>
<p>Many materials that are placed in archival repositories are not formally published in that they have
                  not undergone an editorial, composition and production process, involving review, modification, and
                  packaging by persons other than the original creator(s). While such items may be offered publicly,
                  they are not considered &ldquo;published&rdquo; in a formal sense and their metadata should not ordinarily specify
                  a publisher.</p>
<p>For an entity that has funded the creation or development of the resource in some way, but has not
                  otherwise participated in its development through editing, composition, production, printing,
                  marketing, posting, etc., use the <a href="#Contributor">Contributor</a> element specifying the [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/role.html">OLAC-Role</a>]

<p> Typically, a Rights element will contain a rights management statement for the resource, or reference
                  a service providing such information. Rights information often encompasses Intellectual Property
                  Rights (IPR), Copyright, and various Property Rights. If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions
                  can be made about the status of these and other rights with respect to the resource. </p>
<p>A rights management statement that contains a license or directs a potential user to a license
                  statement that specifies conditions and granted permissions should use the <i>dcterms:license</i>
                  refinement. The <i>dcterms:accessRights</i> refinement should be used to document conditions under
                  which access to the resource is granted. In either case, a statement may be included directly within
                  the metadata, or a URI reference to the statement or a service may be given. Examples of license
                  statements can be found at Creative Commons [<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">CC</a>].</p>
<p>Use <a href="#Rights Holder">Rights Holder</a> (rather than Rights) to specify a person or corporate body
                  (organization, legally constituted entity representing a group or community) that holds the rights to
                  the resource. </p>
<p>Copyright is inherent in primary linguistic and cultural research materials, such as stories,
                  descriptions, songs or art work, which researchers collect in the course of their work. The rights, in
                  most cases, belong to the creator&mdash;not the researcher or sponsor&mdash;or, in some cases, to the language
                  community (particularly, if it is constituted as a legal entity). Intellectual property law as it
                  applies to personal or community cultural property is beyond the scope of these notes. However,
                  documenting the creators of such works, the conditions under which they came into the hands of the
                  researcher, and any known conditions on use (generally non-commercial use) are critical aspects of
                  archiving. To publish or otherwise distribute such works should have the approval of the owner. Only
                  with information about the origins and conditions of collecting can the holding repository or
                  interested researchers make use of such resources in ways that respect the rights and sensibilities of
                  those whose languages and communities are documented.</p>
<p>A fundamental right of a creator is the right to be associated with his or her creation (whether
                  verbal, textual, visual, etc.), regardless of the retention or subsequent assignment of additional
                  rights (to display, distribute copies, modify). Upholding this right must be balanced with a person's
                  right to privacy with regard to identifying information (including the use of photographs).
                  Demographic data about a creator, contributor or research participant, along with identifying
                  information, is often included in research data. Identifying information may be removed prior to
                  deposit, or as a condition of release, or a Rights element may document a statement of permission to
                  use a resource or parts of a resource in a particular way that may otherwise have been an infringement

<p> In the legal parlance of intellectual property rights, a &ldquo;derivative work&rdquo; is one that is based on
                  one or more preexisting works. This includes cases in which a work may be recast, transformed, or
                  adapted in any way, such as by translation, abridgement, dramatization, recording, transcription, or
                  digital encoding. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
                  modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship is also a derivative work
                     [<a href="#Copyright">Copyright</a>].</p>
<p>This legal definition elucidates the sense of &ldquo;derived&rdquo; that is intended in the Dublin Core definition
                  of Source. Note, however, that this overlaps with <a href="#Relation">Relation</a>, since the <i>isFormatOf</i>
                  and <i>isVersionOf</i> refinements both refer to derivative works in the technical sense.</p>
<p>Use Source (as opposed to one of the above two Relation refinements) in cases when the present
                  resource has a substantially different <a href="#Type">Type</a> or <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> or <a href="#Title">Title</a>
                  than the Source resource. When the difference from the original work is only a difference of
                     <a href="#Date">Date</a> or <a href="#Format">Format</a> or <a href="#Publisher">Publisher</a> or <a href="#Identifier">Identifier</a> or
                  edition, then use Relation (or the appropriate refinement) to encode the relationship to the original
                  work.</p>

<p>Recommended best practice is that a metadata record should contain at least one Subject or Coverage

<p>Typically, a Title will be a name by which the resource is formally known. [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMT</a>]</p>
<p>Normally the title of a resource is given to the resource by its creator, be that an author, artist,
                  photographer, or compiler (as the creator of a collection). For a resource that has no formal title
                  given by its creator, the cataloger or archivist should give the work some brief descriptive label as
                  a title. Such a supplied title is typically enclosed in square brackets.</p>
<p>A related use of square brackets is for supplying additional information where, in the opinion of the
                  cataloger, the title itself needs additional clarifying information, or where the formal title
                  contains a typographical or factual error. In such a case, the formal title is transcribed as given,
                  with additional or corrective information supplied in square brackets.</p>
<p>The section above on <a href="#All elements">All elements</a> says
                   that, "Whenever the language of the element content is other than English, recommended best practice
                   is to use the <i>xml:lang</i> attribute to identify
                   the language." This applies to the Title element as
                   well, even when the title is in the same language
                   as that identified in a lone <a href="#Language">Language</a> element.</p>
<p>A translation of the title is supplied in a <i>dcterms:alternative</i> element. Use the
                  <i>xml:lang</i> attribute to identify the language of the translated title using an identifier from
                     [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>].</p>
<p>The only approved use of repeated instances of the Title element is in the case of a polyglot work,
                  where the text is given in two or more languages in some kind of parallel format (whether facing
                  columns or pages, or roughly equal, separate sections) and the title on the title page (or equivalent
                  source of information on/in the resource itself) is given in each of the text languages. This is what
                  librarians refer to as &ldquo;parallel titles.&rdquo; In this case, it is permissible to repeat the Title element.
                  It will be expected that there are also multiple <a href="#Language">Language</a> elements, and that each of the
                  Title elements carries an <i>xml:lang</i> attribute that specifies a language that is also given in
                  one of the Language elements. </p>

<p> Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for

                  read (as text), viewed (as image), heard, etc. Thus, a computer image file of a text (such as a

                  text. To describe the physical or digital manifestation of the resource, use the <a href="#Format">Format</a>

<A name="Granularity of resources"></A>5. Granularity of resources</h2>
<p>Determining the right level for units to be described
                as language resources in the OLAC context involves
                multiple factors. The level of unit appropriate for
                inclusion in an aggregated catalog like OLAC's may be
                different (typically higher) than the level desirable
                for the catalog of a specific institution's holdings,
                which in turn is typically higher than the level
                desirable for describing the detailed contents of a
                resource. Section 6 of the
                [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC-Repositories</a>] standard establishes the
                following basic guideline regarding the granularity of
                the records in an OLAC repository:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A metadata
                repository should treat resources with a single
                provenance as constituting a single unit with respect
                to OLAC metadata and should, therefore, describe them
                within a single record.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following discussion is
                aimed at assisting an OLAC participant to find the
                right level of description.</p>
<p>For a resource that has been published in some form,
                the appropriate unit of description for the OLAC
                record is the unit of the publication itself. A
                collective work (<i>e.g.,</i> a festschrift) may warrant
                separate records for the separate papers contained
                within it (which should be related to the record for the work
                as a whole through the <i>isPartOf</i> and
                <i>hasPart</i> relationships; see
                <a href="#Relation">Relation</a>). In general, the OLAC record
                parallels a citable source. Thus, for published works,
                granularity does not really pose a problem. However,
                many archival resources have not been formally
                published. Unpublished papers that present findings of
                research closely parallel typical publications and can
                be treated in a comparable way as units for archival
                description.</p>
<p>Granularity poses the greatest problem with primary
                source materials (<i>e.g.,</i> recordings,
                transcriptions, annotations, notes, data sets). The
                typical practice of archivists is to gather such
                materials into collections, which in turn become the
                primary units of archival description (<i>i.e.,</i> the
                result is resources of DCMI type <i>collection;</i> see
                <a href="#Type">Type</a>). The collection, for example, of a
                single field trip may contain a large number of
                distinct components&mdash;the separate pieces of
                documentation that comprise the records of a number of
                distinct linguistic events (each with recording,
                transcription, translation, annotation, etc.).
                However, these components are not the units for
                description at the OLAC level. It is the unit of the
                collection that forms the basic unit for OLAC
                description.</p>
<p>The foremost factor in determining what materials
                belong together as a single collection is their
                    <a href="#Provenance">Provenance</a>. In the typical case, the
                collected resources have a common provenance, that is,
                they have a common origin and history. Common origin
                includes who was responsible for collecting the
                materials, as well as when and where they were
                collected. It could be a
                single researcher or a research team, either in the context
                of a single trip or a series of related trips. It
                could also be a project that draws together materials
                from disparate sources for a single new research
                purpose, thus creating a new collection based on a
                secondary use of the materials. Common history is also
                relevant; the fact that the set of resources has been
                moved or changed hands or processed as a whole since
                it was originally collected helps to establish
                its identity as a single unit for archival
                description. </p>
<p>In other cases, materials may have been placed together
                at some point in time well after their creation,
                possibly by the archive itself. If this has occurred,
                there should be some coherent organizing principle or
                intermediate stage of development that is still
                relevant for the proper understanding and use of the
                resources. Materials without a common provenance
                generally should not be made to constitute a
                collection and should not be described collectively in
                an OLAC description.</p>
<p>Situations of shared provenance that constitute a
                collection for arrangement and description purposes
                will be distinguished by the high degree of
                commonality of metadata elements, <i>e.g.,</i> same
                researcher(s), author(s), subject language(s), content
                language(s), approximate dates, coverage, linguistic
                type. Other metadata elements that may also be
                important for resource discovery but that may differ
                for items in the collection (<i>e.g.,</i> format or
                discourse type) can be repeated at the OLAC
                description level for as many values as are
                significantly present in the collection.
                Alternatively, the collection may be divided into
                sub-collections by discourse genre, speaker, or other
                significant feature. The sub-collections can then be
                treated in distinct OLAC records (and related to the
                whole through the <i>isPartOf</i> and <i>hasPart</i>
                relationships; see <a href="#Relation">Relation</a>).</p>
<p>A collection is generally described in greater detail
                through the use of a "finding aid" that gives the
                details of organization and highlights features of
                interest. Further characteristics of individual items
                within a collection (such as topic, additional
                contributors, event specifics, extent, format) are
                documented at a finer level of granularity by creating
                such a collection description. This should also be
                included as a part of the collection, preferably as a
                structured document or metadata set. The Object Reuse
                and Exchange standard currently under development by
                the Open Archives Initiative [<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a>] offers
                a means of handling such descriptions as a different
                kind of harvestable metadata in the OAI-PMH context.
                The session-level detail of [<a href="http://www.mpi.nl/ISLE/documents/draft/ISLE_MetaData_2.5.pdf">IMDI</a>]
                description typically aligns with the finer level of
                description in OAI-ORE rather than the level of Dublin Core
                description in OAI-PMH. </p>
