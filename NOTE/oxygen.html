         <h2><A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction
         </h2>
         <p>&lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor is a full-featured
                        cross-platform XML editor (for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
                        and Eclipse) that provides the tools needed for XML authoring
                        and application development [<a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">oXygen</a>]. It is a
                        mature product (in its Version 10.2 release at the time of
                        writing) that is popular among academics due to its
                        affordable academic license (priced at $48 at the time of
                        writing) [<a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/buy_new_licenses_academic.html">oXygen-Academic</a>]. The fully functional
                        product may be downloaded and freely used for a 30-day
                        evaluation period [<a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/download.html">oXygen-Download</a>].
         </p>
         <p>To install the program, simply download the &lt;oXygen/&gt; package for the
                        appropriate platform from [<a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/download.html">oXygen-Download</a>] and
                        follow the instructions provided on that
                        page. 
         </p>
         <p>The XML Schema validator that is built into
                        &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor is Apache Xerces.
                        For many years, &lt;oXygen/&gt; has not worked properly with
                        OLAC repositories. This is because Xerces 
                        incorrectly failed to validate  the XML schemas for Qualified Dublin
                        Core on which the OLAC metadata standard is based (see
                        Appendix A of [<a href="http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/notes/">DC-Notes</a>]). The problems have now
                        been fixed so that the latest version of &lt;oXygen/&gt;
                        is now able to handle an OLAC repository correctly without
                        requiring special configuration to use a different schema
                        validator.
         </p>
         <p>This document describes how &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor can be used to
                        create and validate a static repository of language
                        resource descriptions that complies with the
                           [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC-Repositories</a>] standard. 
                        Those who create a static
                        repository by running a script over an existing data
                        source do not need a tool like &lt;oXygen/&gt; for
                        creating the repository, but they do need a tool for
                        validating the output of their script; section 2 of this
                        note describes
                        how &lt;oXygen/&gt; can be used for this purpose.
                        Section 3 goes on to describe how it can also be used to
                        create and maintain a static repository as an original
                        data source. 
         </p>
         <h2><A name="Validating a repository"></A>2. Validating a repository
         </h2>
         <p>After starting &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor, use "File / Open" or "File / Open URL" to load the static
                        repository that you wish to validate. For instance, a
                        sample repository can be found at the following URL:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p><a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/static-repository.xml">http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/static-repository.xml</a></p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Click on the Validate Document button (the red check mark
                        in the toolbar). Alternatively you may select "Document / Validate
                        / Validate Document" from the menu bar or use the corresponding keyboard
                        shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+V. The message in
                        the status bar at the bottom of the window will say
                        "Validation &#8212; in progress". On completion it will report
                        either "Document is valid" or "Validation failed"
                        (followed by a count of errors).
                     
         </p>
         <p>When errors are detected, they are indicated in a number
                     of ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>An invalid tag or value is indicated in the
                                 document by a red
                                 underline. The underline will disappear as soon as the
                                 problem is fixed with the editor. Even if you are
                                 testing the validity of a repository that is being
                                 generated by a script, you may find this feature
                                 useful since you can edit the document to test the fix
                                 before making it in the script.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>The vertical scroll bar to the right of the editing
                              page shows a red mark to indicate the location of each
                              error in the document. Drag the scroll bar slider to line
                              up with one of those marks in order to bring the
                              corresponding error into view in the editing pane.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Clicking within document content that has a red
                              underline causes the associated error message to be 
                              displayed at the bottom of the editing pane. If the
                              message is truncated, double click on it to pop up a
                              dialog box showing the full message.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Document validation also opens a pane below the
                                 editing pane which shows a scrolling list of all error
                                 messages. Clicking on a message in that list scrolls
                                 the document to the location of the error and places
                                 the edit cursor at that point in the document. If the
                                 error message is truncated, hover the mouse pointer over
                                 the message to pop up a text box showing the full
                                 message.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you are unable to make sense of an error message, try
                        the SaxonSA schema validator that is built into
                        &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor &#8212; the message reported by it may
                        help to shed more light on what the problem is. This validator is invoked by clicking the
                        "SaxonSA" button in the toolbar. The errors as reported by
                        SaxonSA show up in the scrolling list below the editing
                        pane. Click on the tabs below the list, "Custom Validation
                        - SaxonSA" versus "Errors", to toggle between the two sets of
                        error messages.

         <h2><A name="Creating a repository"></A>3. Creating a repository
         </h2>
         <p>&lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor may also be used 
                        to create a static repository in the first place, and then
                        to maintain it as records need to be added or modified.
                        The easiest way to create a new repository is to load the
                        sample repository from the OLAC site and save it to your
                        computer with a name that is appropriate for the
                        repository you want to create. The sample repository is
                        located at:
                     
         </p>

         </blockquote>
         <p>Open the renamed repository file with &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML
                        Editor and use the editor to change the repository as needed. The
                        primary advantage of starting with the existing sample is
                        that all of the namespace declarations in the root element
                        are known to be correct.
                     
         </p>
         <p>The <tt>Identify</tt> section provides information about your
                        repository. Some of the elements describe generic behavior
                     that is true of all OLAC static repositories and do not need
                     to be changed; others are specific to your repository and
                     must be changed. The following are the elements that you will

                        OLAC metadata records are entered.  The sample repository
                        contains two records.   You can start by deleting
                        one of those records; then edit the remaining record to be
                        the first record in your repository.
         </p>
         <p>The <tt>&lt;oai:header&gt;</tt> part of the record has the
                        following two
                        obligatory elements:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            <dl>
               <dt><b>oai:identifier</b></dt>
               <dd>
                  <p>Enter here the unique OAI identifier for the item. The
                                    identifier is constructed from three parts separated by colon: the
                                    literal string "oai", the <tt>repositoryIdentifier</tt>
                                    as entered above, and a string that identifies the
                                    item uniquely within the set of archive holdings. This
                                    latter part of the identifier, following the second
                                    colon, is the only part that will vary from record to
                                    record. It is under your discretion to assign this
                                    local identifier in whatever way you want.  If the
                                    items in your collection already have some kind of unique identifier,
                                    you may use that. Otherwise, you may do something like
                                    assign a serial number sequentially. The
                                    identifier for a record becomes set the first time it
                                    is harvested. After that it should not be
                                    changed since it is by matching identifiers that the
                                    harvester knows which stored metadata record to update 
                                    when a repository is reharvested.

                                    metadata record.  The datestamp does not describe a
                                    date related to the resource itself (for this, use the date
                                    elements within the metadata part of the record).
                                    Rather, it refers only to the expression of the metadata
                                 in this record. Whenever the record is updated, the
                                 datestamp must be updated. Otherwise, incremental
                                 harvesting will not know that the record has changed and
                                 so will fail to reharvest it.

         <p>The <tt>&lt;oai:metadata&gt;</tt> part of the record is

                        press Enter to open up a new line, type "&lt;" to open a
                        new tag, scroll through the pop-up list of available
                        metadata elements, and press Enter to select the element you want.
                        Also, you may start typing the tag name to narrow the
                        selection list. As you are creating a metadata
                        description, consult the OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines 
                        [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html">OLAC-Usage</a>] for definitions of the available

                                    box and click the "Validate" button.  This performs
                                    the same schema validation that you have been
                                    performing in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. In addition it tests
                                    for other conditions described in
                                    [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC-Repositories</a>] that go beyond schema
                                    validation. If the final line says "FAILURE,"
                                    you still have work to do. Make note of all the
                                    individual tests that failed and fix the offending
                                    content in the repository; then repeat the
                                    validation process. If the XML Schema
                                    Validation is failing, click on the "error logs" link to see
                                    the list of errors generated by the validator. The
                                    two validators report the errors differently, so
                                    look at both logs to get a fuller idea of what is
                                    wrong.

                                 you will be presented with a button that allows you to

                                 further notification after the repository has been
