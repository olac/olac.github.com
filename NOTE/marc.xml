         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p>This note describes a system for transforming the MARC21
            catalog for a library or archive into a static repository
            that holds an OLAC metadata record for each MARC record
            identified as describing a language resource. The
            MARC-to-OLAC crosswalk adds two tasks to a general
            MARC-to-DC crosswalk. First, we require a filtering step
            to determine whether a record describes a language
            resource. Second, if it does, we must extract the
            specialized metadata that facilitates language resource
            discovery. A fairly narrow subset of Library of Congress
            Subject Headings (LCSH) is used in cataloging language
            resources. The simple existence of the word “language” in
            subfield $a of an entry element is the main clue;
            institution-specific cata¬loging policies may also prove
            relevant. If it contains one or more of these clues, a
            record passes through the filter stage. Then a
            transformation stage applies specialized mappings for
            identifying languages and the type of a language resource.
            OLAC metadata uses ISO 639-2/3
            [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/] as an encoding scheme for
            precise identification of languages We have thus mapped
            LCSH “language names” to their corresponding ISO 639
            identifiers for use with DC:Language and OLAC’s “language
            as subject” extension of DC:Subject. Specific LCSH terms
            are also mapped to OLAC’s linguistic resource type
            vocabulary applied as an extension to DC:Type. </p>
         <p>The crosswalk is implemented with a series of XSL
            transforma¬tions driven by a Python wrapper script. The
            Python script applies the transformations in batches and
            is thereby able to process gigabytes of MARC data with
            minimal memory requirements. The preliminary filtering
            step is configured by specifying tests on any MARC field
            or subfield with simple string comparison. We use a
            two-stage filtering process in which the first stage (the
            “select stage”) uses tests to select the maximal set of
            MARC records to be considered for inclusion in the OLAC
            repository, while the second stage (the “reject stage”)
            uses tests to reject records that are in fact not wanted.
            The resulting record set is then transformed from MARC XML
            to OLAC’s XML-based format by means of an XSL stylesheet
            that defines an &lt;xsl:template> for each MARC field.
            An optional stylesheet is called to apply overriding
            institution-specific mappings. The complete source code
            and data tables for the crosswalk (including the LCSH to
            ISO 639-3 mappings) are being shared on an open-source
            basis.</p>
