<h2>
<A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The vision of OLAC is that "any user on the Internet should be able to go to a single
            gateway to find all the language resources available at all participating institutions"
            (see vision statement in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/process.html#Governing%20ideas">OLAC-Process</a>]). The ability of a user to discover any
            relevant language resource is dependent on the quality of the metadata that describe
            it. Ensuring quality through peer review is a core value that OLAC employs to achieve
            its vision. "OLAC also conducts automated review based on peer consensus regarding best
            practice" (see core value statements in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/process.html#Governing%20ideas">OLAC-Process</a>]). </p>
<p>This note explains the automated system that is implemented on the OLAC web site for
            evaluating the quality of metadata records. The peer consensus regarding best practice
            is expressed in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/bpr.html">OLAC-BPR</a>] and further elucidated in [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html">OLAC-Usage</a>]. </p>
<h2>
<A name="The quality score"></A>2. The quality score</h2>
<p>Many of the best practice recommendations for resource description cannot be
            automatically checked for conformance; however, there are many that can be. As an aid to
            creating descriptive metadata that meet the latter set of recommendations, OLAC has
            implemented an automated metadata quality score. Each metadata record receives a score in the range
            of 0 to 10 based on the presence or absence of recommended practices. In some contexts
            the score is reported as a number in this range; in others it is summarized graphically
            as a rating of 1 to 5 stars. That is, any score above 9 is reported as 5 stars, scores
            in the range of 7 to 9 are reported as 4 stars, and so on.</p>
<p>The practices in focus for the evaluation of metadata quality 
            are ones that contribute to resource discovery. The score has two
            major parts: 50% is based on the metadata elements that are present and 50% is based on
            the use of encoding schemes. The elements provide the breadth and depth of the
            description, while the encoding schemes provide precision for interoperable searching. </p>
<p>The element part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four basic
            metadata elements that must be present to give the record minimal breadth of coverage,
            plus a further point awarded for additional elements that add to the depth of
            description. In the descriptions below, a non-empty metadata element is one that
            supplies a value, whether through element content or through the <i>olac:code</i>
            attribute. The element-based components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Title</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of a non-empty Tittle element. Absence of a
                  title that is inherent to the resource does not block achieving this point, since
                  in that case it is recommended best practice for the cataloger to supply a
                  descriptive title enclosed in square brackets. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Date</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty Date element (or
                  any of its refinements). Absence of a date in the resource itself does not block
                  achieving this point, since in that case it is recommended best practice for the
                  cataloger to supply an
                  estimated date enclosed in square brackets. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Agent (Contributor, Creator, or Publisher)</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that
                  provides an indication of who is behind the resource, whether as Contributor or
                  Creator or Publisher.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>About (Subject, Description, or Coverage)</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that
                  provides an indication of what the resource is about, whether Subject or
                  Description or Coverage (or any refinement of the latter two). </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Depth</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One-sixth point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each element that is
                  present in addition to the 8 that must be present in order to receive the 4 points
                  above for basic elements and the 4 points that follow for basic encoding schemes.
                  If the record has fewer than 8 elements, this part of the score is 0; otherwise,
                  it is (total elements - 8) / 6 or 1, whichever is less.
                  Note that in order to get the full score on this point, a record must contain at least
                  14 elements. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>The encoding scheme part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four
            basic element-plus-scheme pairs that must be present to support high recall and
            precision in searches for language resources. A further point is awarded for additional
            use of encoding schemes that add to the precision of resource description. The
            scheme-based components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Content Language</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Language element that uses
                  the <i>olac:ISO639-3</i> encoding scheme [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>] to precisely identify the language of
                  content of the resource. Absence of any natural language content in a resource
                  (such as in a software tool) does not block achieving this point, since in that
                  case it is recommended best practice is to use the ISO 639-3 code <tt>zxx</tt>
                  meaning "No linguistic content." </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Linguistic Type</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses the
                  <i>olac:linguistic-type</i> encoding scheme [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type.html">OLAC-Linguistic-Type</a>] to precisely identify the type
                  of the resource from a linguistic point of view. Such a metadata element is
                  relevant to all OLAC records since the vocabulary includes a "not_applicable"
                  value for items that are not an instance of one of the linguistic data types.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Subject Language</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for appropriate use of the <i>olac:ISO639-3</i> encoding
                  scheme [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/language.html">OLAC-Language</a>] with the Subject element to precisely identify the language that the
                  resource is about. The notion of subject language is not relevant to every
                  language resource. When the linguistic type of a resource is "primary_text" or
                  "not_applicable" it is not required to have a subject language, and this point is
                  awarded automatically. Otherwise, there must be at least one Subject element using
                  the <i>olac:ISO639-3</i> encoding scheme in order to earn the point. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>DCMI Type</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses the
                  <i>dcterms:DCMIType</i> encoding scheme [<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/">DCMI-Type</a>]  to identify the generic type of the
                  resource. The vocabulary is designed to be applicable to any resource and this is
                  considered mandatory for OLAC metadata in order to support reliable searching for
                  resources by type (such as audio recordings versus video recordings versus textual
                  data versus software).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Precision</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>One-third point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each additional
                  encoding scheme that is used in the metadata record. Thus in order to earn full
                  points, a record must use at least three encoding schemes in addition to <i>olac:ISO639-3</i>,
                  <i>olac:linguistic-type</i>, and <i>dcterms:DCMIType</i>. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The free-standing metadata service [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/tools/metadata/freestanding.html">OLAC-Free</a>] can be used to see what quality
            score will be awarded to a given OLAC metadata record. The XML encoding of a record is
            pasted into a submission form. The service then validates the record, and if it is valid, a
            report of its quality score is generated with comments on what must be done to raise the
            score to 10. The same quality analysis is shown for a sample record from each
            participating archive by following the "Sample Record" link on the
            [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives-new.php4">OLAC-Archives</a>] page. </p>
<p>The average quality score for all the records provided by a given participating archive
            can be seen by following the "Metrics" link on the [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives-new.php4">OLAC-Archives</a>] page. The
            metrics report also shows the breakdown across the collection of all the components that
            go into the quality score.</p>
