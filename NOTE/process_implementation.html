<h2>
<A name="Site organization"></A>1. Site organization</h2>
<p>The gateway for the Open Language Archives Community is hosted at
        <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/">http://www.language-archives.org/</a>. The following are the pages in
        the root folder of the site:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">/                    Home page
/organization.html   How OLAC is organized
/archives.html       Index of participating archives
/services.html       Index of participating services
</pre>
<p>The following are root-level folders:</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 12pt">/OLAC/    Holds documents in the standards track
/REC/     Holds documents in the recommendations track
/NOTE/    Holds docuemnts in the notes track
/src/     Holds XML source files for documents in the above three tracks
/docs/    Holds documents that are not official OLAC documents
/wg/      Holds the home pages for the working groups</pre>
<p>An index page in each of these folders (except <tt>src</tt>) offers
        visitors a complete list of what is available.</p>
<h2>
<A name="Use of mailing lists"></A>2. Use of mailing lists</h2>
<p>Mailing lists are used to implement much of the business of the
        community. The mailing lists are hosted at
        <tt>listserv.linguistlist.org.</tt>
</p>
<p>Two lists are closed. Their subscriber lists are maintained by the
        OLAC Coordinators. In order to prevent subscription requests from the public at
        large, the lists are not made visible on the OLAC site nor on the mailing list
        archives page at Linguist List [<a href="#LL-Archives">LL-Archives</a>]. The identity of the
        subscribers, however, is open and visible on the OLAC Organization page
        [<a href="#OLAC-Organization">OLAC-Organization</a>]. The list archives can also be openly accessed via
        the form for accessing unlisted archives [<a href="#LL-Unlisted">LL-Unlisted</a>]. The two closed
        lists are:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OLAC-Advisors</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A mailing list that the OLAC Coordinators use for interacting with the
        OLAC Advisory Board, and which the board members may also use for interacting
        with each other.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>OLAC-Archives</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A mailing list that the OLAC Coordinators use for interacting with the
        Participating Archives and Services, and which the participants may also use
        for interacting with each other. There is only one subscriber per participating
        archive or service, and that is the person who is designated by the sponsoring
        institution to be the official contact person for OLAC business. At the
        discretion of the Coordinators, a contact person from selected Prospective
        Participants may also be subscribed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>All other lists are open. They are listed on the OLAC site and at
        Linguist List [<a href="#LL-Archives">LL-Archives</a>]. They are set up in such a way that
        interested parties may subscribe themselves to the lists. There are two
        "built-in" public lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>OLAC-General</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A mailing list that the OLAC Coordinators use to make Calls for
        Pariticipation, Calls for Review, and other public announcements to the full
        list of Participating Individuals. This list is set up as a moderated list so
        that the only traffic on it is annoucements from OLAC.
        </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>OLAC-Implementors</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A mailing list for a working group consisting of all those who are
        implementing the OLAC standards or are interested in doing so. While a working
        group is, in general, constituted for the purpose of developing designated
        documents and may dissolve once its documents are completed, this working group
        is created as a perpetual group to support those who are implementing the
        standards. It may also develop documents, but its existence is not dependent on
        this. This list is unmoderated so that implementors may interact freely with
        each other.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>For every other working group, there is an open and unmoderated
        mailing list with a name of the form: OLAC-<i>Groupname</i>
</p>
<h2>
<A name="Working group pages"></A>3. Working group pages</h2>
<p>Every working group has a home page on the OLAC site. That page
        includes the following information in a format which is uniform across all
        working group pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the name of the working group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a statement of purpose for the working group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the name and email address of the chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>links to the mailing list which offer the following functions:
            list group members, read mail archive, join group, resign from group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>links to ballots that are currently open </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>links to results of ballots that have closed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a listing of the documents of the working group</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The document listing should include both documents that are in
        progress and those that are. Only the latest version of each document should be
        listed since each version of a document gives a link to its previous version
        (and so on). For each document the following information should be shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the name of the document (as a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the type of the document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the status of the document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the latest date of issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an optional comment describing the next major milestone and a
            target date</p>
</li>
</ul>
