            <p>The original implementation flagged a private use
               language code in the range <tt>qaa</tt> to <tt>qtz</tt> as a "Bad
               Langauge Code" error. This is now treated as a "Private
               Use Language Code" warning as described in the
               section on <xref>Integrity checks</xref>.</p>

            <heading>Introduction</heading>
            <p>The vision of OLAC is that "any user on the Internet should be able to go to a single
                gateway to find all the language resources available at all participating
                institutions" (see vision statement in <cit>OLAC-Process</cit>). The ability of a
                user to discover any relevant language resource is dependent on the quality of the
                metadata that describe it. Ensuring quality through peer review is a core value that
                OLAC employs to achieve its vision. "OLAC also conducts automated review based on
                peer consensus regarding best practice" (see core value statements in
                    <cit>OLAC-Process</cit>). </p>
            <p>Section 2 of this note explains the automated system that is implemented on the OLAC
                web site for evaluating the quality of metadata records. Section 3 explains the
                derivation of the overall quality rating as a score of
                0 to 5 stars, based on the average metadata quality
                score less a deduction for known integrity problems if
                there are any. 
                Section 4 explains the integrity checks that are
                performed. Finally, section 5
                explains the other metrics that are reported in the <cit>OLAC-Metrics</cit> reports
                to support comparison of size and coverage of collections in addition to aspects of
                metadata quality and usage.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <heading>The quality score</heading>
            <p>The peer consensus regarding best practice is expressed in <cit>OLAC-BPR</cit> and
                further elucidated in <cit>OLAC-Usage</cit>. Many of the best practice
                recommendations for resource description cannot be automatically checked for
                conformance; however, there are many that can be. As an aid to creating descriptive
                metadata that meet the latter set of recommendations, OLAC has implemented an
                automated metadata quality score. Each metadata record receives a score in the range
                of 0 to 10 based on the presence or absence of recommended practices. </p>
            <p>The practices in focus for the evaluation of metadata quality are ones that
                contribute to resource discovery. The score has two major parts: 50% is based on the
                metadata elements that are present and 50% is based on the use of encoding schemes.
                The elements provide the breadth and depth of the description, while the encoding
                schemes provide precision for interoperable searching. </p>
            <p>The element part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four basic
                metadata elements that must be present to give the record minimal breadth of
                coverage, plus a further point awarded for additional elements that add to the depth
                of description. In the descriptions below, a non-empty metadata element is one that
                supplies a value, whether through element content or through the <i>olac:code</i>
                attribute. The element-based components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Title</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of a non-empty Title element. Absence
                        of a title that is inherent to the resource does not block achieving this
                        point, since in that case it is recommended best practice for the cataloger
                        to supply a descriptive title enclosed in square brackets. </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Date</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty Date element
                        (or any of its refinements). Absence of a date in the resource itself does
                        not block achieving this point, since in that case it is recommended best
                        practice for the cataloger to supply an estimated date enclosed in square
                        brackets. </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Agent (Contributor, Creator, or Publisher)</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that
                        provides an indication of who is behind the resource, whether as Contributor
                        or Creator or Publisher.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>About (Subject, Description, or Coverage)</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one non-empty element that
                        provides an indication of what the resource is about, whether Subject or
                        Description or Coverage (or any refinement of the latter two). </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Depth</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One-sixth point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each element
                        that is present in addition to the 8 that must be present in order to
                        receive the 4 points above for basic elements and the 4 points that follow
                        for basic encoding schemes. If the record has fewer than 8 elements, this
                        part of the score is 0; otherwise, it is (total elements - 8) / 6 or 1,
                        whichever is less. Note that in order to get the full score on this point, a
                        record must contain at least 14 elements. </p>
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>The encoding scheme part of the score consists of 4 points awarded for each of four
                basic element-plus-scheme pairs that must be present to support high recall and
                precision in searches for language resources. A further point is awarded for
                additional use of encoding schemes that add to the precision of resource
                description. The scheme-based components of the score are awarded as follows:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Content Language</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Language element that
                        uses the <i>olac:language</i> encoding scheme with a value from 
                        <cit>OLAC-Language</cit> in <i>olac:code</i> to
                        precisely identify the language of content of the resource. Absence of any
                        natural language content in a resource (such as in a software tool) does not
                        block achieving this point, since in that case it is recommended best
                        practice is to use the ISO 639-3 code <tt>zxx</tt> meaning "No linguistic
                        content." </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Linguistic Type</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses
                        the <i>olac:linguistic-type</i> encoding scheme with a value from <cit>OLAC-Type</cit>
                        in <i>olac:code</i> to
                        precisely identify the type of the resource from a linguistic point of view.
                        Such a metadata element is relevant to the majority of OLAC records, but not
                        to all. The remedy that has been identified is to extend the Linguistic Data
                        Type vocabulary to a generally applicable Language Resource Type vocabulary
                        that will be relevant to all OLAC records. Until the work is done to
                        redefine the vocabulary, records for which Linguistic Data Type is not
                        relevant will not earn this point.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Subject Language</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Subject element that
                        uses the <i>olac:language</i> encoding
                        scheme with a value from <cit>OLAC-Language</cit> in <i>olac:code</i>
                        ito precisely
                        identify the language that the resource is about. The notion of subject
                        language is not relevant to every language resource. When the linguistic
                        type of a resource is "primary_text" it is not required to have a subject
                        language, and this point is awarded automatically. (Until the problem
                        mentioned above under Linguistic Type is solved by creating a more general
                        Language Resource Type vocabulary, the point will also be awarded
                        automatically when there is no instance of <i>olac:linguistic-type</i>. This
                        means that a resource other than a primary text for which subject language
                        is truly not applicable will lose the point for Linguistic Type, but not be
                        doubly penalized in the point for Subject Language.) When the linguistic
                        type has any other value, there must be at least one Subject element using
                        the <i>olac:language</i> encoding scheme in order to earn this point. </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>DCMI Type</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One point is awarded for the presence of at least one Type element that uses
                        the <i>dcterms:DCMIType</i> encoding scheme <cit>DCMI-Type</cit> to identify
                        the generic type of the resource. The vocabulary is designed to be
                        applicable to any resource and this is considered mandatory for OLAC
                        metadata in order to support reliable searching for resources by type (such
                        as audio recordings versus video recordings versus textual data versus
                        software).</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Precision</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One-third point (up to a maximum of one point) is awarded for each additional
                        encoding scheme that is used in the metadata record. Thus in order to earn
                        full points, a record must use at least three encoding schemes in addition
                        to <i>olac:language</i>, <i>olac:linguistic-type</i>, and
                            <i>dcterms:DCMIType</i>. </p>

            <p>The free-standing metadata service <cit>OLAC-Free</cit> can be used to see what
                quality score will be awarded to a given OLAC metadata record. The XML encoding of a
                record is pasted into a submission form. The service then validates the record, and
                if it is valid, a report of its quality score is generated with comments on what
                must be done to raise the score to 10. The same quality analysis is shown for a
                sample record from each participating archive by following the "Sample Record" link
                on the <cit>OLAC-Archives</cit> page. </p>
            <p>The average quality score for all the records provided by a given participating
                archive can be seen by following the "Metrics" link on the <cit>OLAC-Archives</cit>
                page. The metrics report also shows the breakdown across the collection of all the
                components that go into the quality score.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <heading>Overall rating</heading>
            <p>The overall metadata quality is summarized graphically as a rating of 0 to 5 stars.
                The overall rating is computed as a base rating minus a penalty if the metadata are
                known to contain integrity violations.</p>
            <p>The base rating is computed from the average of <xref>The quality score</xref> for
                all records in the repository, The average quality score ranges from 0 to 10 and is
                converted to stars by dividing by 2 and rounding to the nearest whole number. Thus,
                an average quality score of 9 or higher converts to 5 stars, scores in the range of
                7 to 9 convert to 4 stars, and so on.</p>
            <p>In the absence of known integrity problems, the overall rating is reported as the
                base rating. If integrity problems have been detected, one star is subtracted
                from the base rating. The metrics report for the archive with identifier
                   <i>archive-id</i> is found at:</p>
           <eg>http://www.language-archives.org/metrics/archive-id</eg>
           <p>If the reported number of "Known Integrity Problems" is greater
              than 0, then one star has been deducted from the overall
              rating. When the number is 0, but formatted as a link to
              the integrity report, no deduction has been made but
              there are warnings of potential problems. The next section describes
                the integrity violations and warnings that are detected
                automatically:</p>

          <p>The report of known and potential integrity problems for the archive with identifier
             <i>archive-id</i> is found at:</p>
          <eg>http://www.language-archives.org/checks/archive-id</eg>
          <p>The report has two sections: Errors (which cause a
             deduction to the overall rating) and Warnings (which do
             not). The report has three columns: the error or warning
             message, the offending value, and the id of the record
             the problem occurs
             in (as a link to the online display of the record).
             The top of the report has a link which allows the information to be
             downloaded in TSV (tab-separated value) format. In the
             download table, the message is reported as a three-letter
          code and an extra column with value E or W is added to indicate the severity
          as "Error" or "Warning". </p>

            <heading>Other metrics</heading>
            <p>The <cit>OLAC-Metrics</cit> page reports a set of metrics that summarize the size and
                coverage of each participating archive as well as the quality of their metadata
                records. The "OLAC Archive Metrics" tab reports the metrics for the participating
                archive that has been selected from the drop down list. The "Comparative Archive
                Metrics" tab shows the summary statistics for all participating archives in a single
                table. When first opened, the rows of the table are in alphabetical order of the
                archive names. The rows can be reordered to reflect their rank with respect to a
                particular metric by clicking in the column header for that metric. Clicking again
                reverses the order.</p>
            <p>When "ALL ARCHIVES" is selected, the Summary Statistics table begins with the
                following three metrics that apply only to the OLAC catalog as a whole; when an
                individual archive is selected, these metrics are absent.</p>

            <p>The OLAC Archive Metrics page continues with a Metadata Usage summary consisting of

                    <p>This histogram reports the use of core metadata components as recommended by
                            <cit>OLAC-BPR</cit>. The eight lines correspond to the eight components
                        of <xref>The quality score</xref> that awarded as full points for the
                        presence or absence of a recommended element or encoding scheme. The length
                        of a bar represents the percentage of metadata records that contain that
                        metadata component. </p>

                    <p>This histogram lists all of the metadata elements in the Dublin Core scheme.
                        The length of a bar represents the total number of times a given element has
                        been used within the records of the selected archive. It is the count of
                        element uses (not records that use the element); thus the counts exceed the
                        total number of resources in the archive for elements that occur multiple
                        times per record.</p>

                        the Dublin Core scheme. The length of a bar represents the total number of
                        times a given refinement has been used within the records of the selected
                        archive. It is the count of refinement uses (not records that use the
                        refinement); thus the counts exceed the total number of resources in the
                        archive for refinements that occur multiple times per record.</p>

                        of the <i>xsi:type</i> attribute. The length of a bar represents the total
                        number of times a given encoding scheme has been used within the records of
                        the selected archive. It is the count of encoding scheme uses (not records
                        that use the encoding scheme); thus the counts exceed the total number of
