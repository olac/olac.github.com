      <heading>Overview</heading>
      <p>This Note presents a framework
for creating OLAC records and static
repositories in Toolbox. The framework consists of the following
components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A
Toolbox project (<url>http://localhost:8080/tbox/OLAC_in_Toolbox_Generic.zip</url>), created
by Joan Spanne of SIL, that can serve
as a template for creating OLAC records.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A program called BoxReader
that converts Toolbox files into XML
(XHTML, to be precise) without loss of information. BoxReader can
operate on a wide range of Toolbox data files, as long as they are
accompanied by the matching .typ files.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>XSLT stylesheets that
convert the output of BoxReader into an
OLAC repository.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An HTML file, index.html,
with forms for submitting Toolbox files
and running the software (BoxReader and XSLT files). This file also
serves as the User Guide. The User-Guide portion of the page is
reproduced in the final section of this Note.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To create OLAC metadata in
Toolbox, you only need to download Joan
Spanne's project. The software
can be run remotely from <url>http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/tbox</url> or you can run it on your own
computer after installing the Tomcat
web server. (Note that the computer <i>does
not to have to be
connected to the
Internet</i>, but it does need
Tomcat installed.) Both Tomcat and
BoxReader are written in Java, so Java also needs to be installed.
After installing Java and Tomcat, download and install the
that
contains all the software. The rest
of this Note provides
installation instructions and a user
guide. If you would like to see the
transformations of Joan Spanne's example, go directly to <url>http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/tbox20060906/</url>
and run it as a demo.</p>

    <section>
      <heading>The Computing Platform</heading>
      <p>The platform consists of two
big enabling components: Java and
Tomcat.</p>
      <subsection>
        <subheading>Java</subheading>
        <p>Start by checking whether you
have Java on your computer, and if so,
what version.</p>
        <p> On Windows. go Start -
Settings - Control Panel. If there is no
Java control panel, you need to install Java. If there is such a panel,
open it, select the General tab, click About. If the version is earlier
than 1.5.0, you do have to install Java.</p>
        <p>Java installers can be
downloaded from the
Sun J2SE download page (<url>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</url>). The page
has a help
link at <url>http://java.sun.com/downloads/faq.html</url>.
Since we use JSP (JavaServer Pages) in our code, you must download and
install the JDK, not JRE. Install the latest update, but probably not
the one that included Netbeans or JavaEE.
</p>
        <p>Once you have installed Java or
established that you already have an
adequate version, you need to create the JAVA_HOME environment
variable, pointing to the directory where you have installed Java.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection>
        <subheading>Tomcat</subheading>
        <p>Tomcat's main web page is <url>http://tomcat.apache.org/</url>.
It has links to both
Download and Documentation pages. Within the current documentation (August 2006, version 5.5, <url>http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/setup.html</url>) there is a setup section
giving setup directions for Windows
and several versions of Unix. Follow the directions so that Tomcat
starts automatically every time your restart your computer.</p>
        <p>Installing Tomcat on the OS X
Macintosh is slightly more involved.
Official but seriously dated instructions can be found at Java
and Tomcat on Mac OS X, Part I (<url>http://developer.apple.com/internet/java/tomcat1.html</url>) and Java
and Tomcat on Mac OS X, Part II (<url>http://developer.apple.com/internet/java/tomcat2.html</url>). One problem is that a version of Java adequate for Tomcat is not
necessarily adequate for the OLAC webapp; so far as we know, you cannot
upgrade your Java to 1.5.0 or better (confusingly known as J2SE 5.0) unless your OS X is upgraded to 10.4 or better. If you have OS 10.4 but not Java 1.5.0, you can download the
Java upgrade from Apple's Developer Connection Java
downloads (<url>http://developer.apple.com/java/download/</url>). We used Ben Slade's Instructions for Installing Java, Tomcat, and MySQL on Mac OS X 10.4.x (<url>http://www.benslade.com/projects/java/tomcat/InstallingJavaTomcatMySQLOnMacOSX/</url>) without great difficulty.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection>
        <subheading>BoxReader</subheading>
        <p>Once Tomcat is installed, place
the tbox.war file into Tomcat's
subdirectory called webapps. Tomcat will automatically recognize it and
unpack it into a subdirectory of webapps called tbox. This completes
the installation.</p>

      <heading>Instructions on Use</heading>
      <p>The process of converting
metadata created in Toolbox
into an OLAC static repository goes through two steps. In
the first step, Toolbox-created metadata is converted into
an XML document containing a collection of metadata records.
The records are in the correct OLAC format, but the entire
collection is not an OLAC-conformant repository. We make
this a separate step in case you want to copy and paste the
records into a repository that already exists. In the second
step, the output of the first step is converted into a full-fledged
static repository. An important part of the second step is the process
of entering your OLAC headers, such as the repository name, its base
URL, the name of the curator(s), and so on. (See below subsection on
Customizations.)</p>
      <p>At <url>http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/tbox</url>
we provide a form for each step so you can specify the
input files. They can be specified in two ways: by providing
a URL or by pasting the contents of the input file into a
text area. If the URL input box is not empty then the URL is
used, otherwise the contents of the text area are used.</p>
      <p>If you simply click the submit
buttons of Forms 1 and 2, you
will see the demo we have prepared. If you want to use the software
to create and convert your own metadata files, there are three
options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Create your own Tomcat
installation as explained above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Place your data files on a
web server and provide URLs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you only want to make
changes in the Toolbox project, you can open your .db and/or .typ files
in a text editor and copy-paste into the appropriate text areas of the
forms.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For additional detail and a demo, go to the csproj2.colgate.edu
site. As the site explains, an important part of the process is</p>

      <heading>Customizations</heading>
      <p>The example we show in our demo identifies
the static repository as belonging to
N-topus Software, with our own email addresses. These values are
defined within a listing of lookup:strings at the top of the <tt>repository.xsl</tt> file,
and can easily be edited in a plain text editor. (Only the values, not
markup, need to be changed.) Here are the lines to be edited:</p>
      <eg>&lt;lookup:strings&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='repositoryName'&gt;Virtual Toolbox-Sample Archive&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='baseURL'&gt;http://www.n-topus.com/nsf/toolbox/sample/olac-records.xml&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='protocolVersion'&gt;2.0&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='adminEmail'&gt;mailto:tom@n-topus.com&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='earliestDatestamp'&gt;2006-05-03&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='deletedRecord'&gt;no&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='granularity'&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='repositoryIdentifier'&gt;sample.toolbox.nsf.n-topus.com&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='sampleIdentifier'&gt;oai:sample.toolbox.nsf.n-topus.com:01&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id='archiveURL'&gt;http://www.n-topus.com/nsf/toolbox/sample/&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="curator"&gt;Tom Myers, Alexander D. Nakhimovsky&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="curatorTitle"&gt;&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="curatorEmail"&gt;mailto:tom@n-topus.com&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="institution"&gt;N-Topus Software&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="institutionURL"&gt;http://www.n-topus.com/&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="shortLocation"&gt;Hamilton, NY, USA&lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="location"&gt;56 Payne Street, Hamilton NY 13346, USA &lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="synopsis"&gt;This Virtual Toolbox-Sample Archive contains materials assembled from<br/>    Toolbox projects within subdirectories of a web application.<br/>  &lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>  &lt;lookup:string id="access"&gt;Access control is determined by server configuration (e.g., web.xml files). &lt;/lookup:string&gt;<br/>&lt;/lookup:strings&gt;</eg>
      <p>One further customization concerns the value of the baseURL string.
This value can be replaced with the dynamic URL that invokes the
repository.xsl program. When you click the CreateOLAC button, it
connects to this dynamic URL:</p>
      <eg>http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/tbox20060904/xslt.jsp?<br/>xml=olac%2FOLAC_naskapi_db.xml&amp;xsl=repository.xsl&amp;<br/>mimeType=text%2Fxml%3Bcharset%3DUTF-8
</eg>
      <p>The hostname on that URL will naturally be your hostname, where
you're running Tomcat.
Consider the segment of the URL between the ? and the first &amp;
character. It specifies the subdirectory name and the name of your XML
file that you saved in Step 1. If you replace this segment with your
own values, and further replace the baseURL value with the revised
dynamic URL, the static repository
will change automatically any time the underlying XML file changes.
(The underlying
XML presumably will change when you edit your Toolbox .db file and go
through Step 1, replacing the
previous XML file.)</p>
