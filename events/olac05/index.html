<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Over the last several decades, the rise of new technologies has drastically
changed the  nature of linguistic resources. Whereas formerly primary
documentary evidence for a language consisted of notebooks and analog
recordings, today linguists doing documentary work have a  bewildering array of
choices of media, tools, and standards to choose from when creating materials.
</p>

<p>
The production of textual materials, for example, is complicated by the plethora
of choices in computer software. Typical word processors are designed for the
business world  where documents do not generally need to be preserved for
centuries, as is the case with endangered language documentation. Furthermore,
much linguistic documentation does not  consist of unstructured prose, which is
what word processors are designed for, but, rather, highly structured
information, like entries in a lexicon or morphological paradigms. In the ideal
case,  such data would be entered into a database where its structure could be
properly encoded. There are a variety of database programs which can be used for
this purpose, but most of them have the  same limitations as word
processors&mdash;they produce proprietary, short-lived formats that are 
difficult to migrate forward as technologies and methodologies evolve.
</p>

<p>
Another layer of
complexity is that different digital resources need to be properly "linked" in
order for them to have maximal value. Documentation may begin with audio or
video  recordings, but often a transcription and text analysis will also be
created to accompany a recording. Ideally, recordings should not be inextricably
linked to any particular analysis.  However, any researcher making use of a
recording would almost certainly want to be aware of an accompanying
transcription or analysis. Dealing with the problem of indicating relationships
among related resources is a problem in the creation of metadata&mdash;that is,
archival data about resources which facilitates their access.
</p>

<p>
A final issue
engendered by the rise of new technologies for documentation is how to manage
&quot;legacy&quot; data&mdash;that is, data produced before the rise of digital 
tools&mdash;in order to make it  accessible and to preserve it for future 
generations. Some important questions in this area include: What is the best way 
to digitize field notes and analog recordings? And, who has the  rights to 
material produced before the academic community became more sensitive to the 
relationship between communities of speakers and data from their languages? 
</p>

<p>
At present, it is difficult for linguists to locate specific recommendations for 
creating archivable resources. The purpose of this tutorial was to create a 
forum wherein linguists who have created, or are planning to create, documentary 
linguistic resources could access a range of talks on current accepted standards 
of best practice for resource production and conservation. The tutorial aimed 
for breadth, rather than depth, of coverage in order to address the needs of as 
many individuals as possible. By hearing from a number of experts from different 
areas, attendees of the tutorial&mdash;or readers of these materials&mdash;should 
be able to identify appropriate individuals whom they can contact in order to 
get answers  to their specific questions.

<b>Robert Munro, Endangered Languages Archive,SOAS</b><br>
<b>David Nathan, Endangered Languages Archive, SOAS</b><br>
<i>Archives, linguists, and language speakers</i>
</p>

<p>
This talk begins by addressing the following broad questions:
</p>

<p>
1. What is language archiving? <br>

2. What kinds of language archives are there? <br>

3. Who uses language archives?<br>

4. Why should linguists work together with a language archive?<br>
<p>


<p>
It then examines the following two questions in more detail:
</p>

<p>
5. What can a language archive (eg. SOAS-ELAR) offer you?<br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Security - keep your electronic materials safe</li>
	<li>Preservation - store your materials for the long term</li>
	<li>Discovery - help others to find out about your materials</li>
	<li>Protocol - respect and implement any sensitivities or restrictions</li>
	<li>Sharing - share the results of your work with others, if appropriate</li>
	<li>Acknowledgement - create citable acknowledgment of your research</li>
	<li>Mobilisation - provide help to create usable language materials for  communities</li>
	<li>Quality and standards - give advice for assuring your materials are of the highest quality and robust standards</li>
</ul>

<p>
6. What can you archive and what do you have to do to archive your materials?
</p>

<p>
All types of materials relating to endangered languages can be deposited. The 
archivist will ask you to provide cataloguing metadata and to keep in contact in 
order to ensure that rights information is kept up to date. They may also 
require you to put your data in a particular format. Typically, a catalogue of 
deposited materials will appear on the world wide web. Items will be accessible 
to others, subject to the wishes of the information providers. 
</p>

<p>
ELAR (and other archives) also offer other services:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>assistance with preparing materials for archiving</li>
	<li>facilities for digitising documents and media</li>
	<li>practical resource development (on a collaborative project basis)</li>
	<li>training </li>
</ul>

<i>The Open Language Archives Community:
Building a worldwide library of digital language resources
</i>
</p>

<p>
New ways of documenting and describing language via digital media coupled with
new ways of distributing the results via the World-Wide Web offer a degree of
access to language resources that is unparalleled in history. At the same time,
the proliferation of approaches to using these new technologies is causing
serious problems relating to resource discovery and resource creation. The Open
Language Archives Community (OLAC) is an international partnership of almost 30
projects and institutions who are addressing these issues by (1) developing
consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language
resources, and (2) developing a network of interoperating repositories and
services for housing and accessing such resources. 
</p>
<p>
This talk presents the OLAC vision for creating a virtual library of the
language resources that are housed all over the world by its member archives.
It then describes the infrastructure that has been built in order to achieve
this objective.  Special attention is given to explaining the various mechanisms
that make it possible for a project or institution to become a participating
archive and to demonstrating the global search portal that allows any Web user
to present a single search query to all participating archives at once.

<i>The E-MELD School of Best Practices</i>
</p>

<p>
The Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data (E-MELD) Project, is
a five-year collaborative project designed to build digital infrastructure for
the long term preservation of linguistic documentation in "best practice"
format.  Best practice recommendations are designed to ensure that digital
language resources will remain accessible and intelligible by future
generations.  A goal of the E-MELD project is to create a comprehensive but
user-friendly website which offers information about creating such resources;
this is the E-MELD School of Best Practices in Digital Language Documentation
(http://emeld.org/school/), which was demonstrated at this symposium. The
site includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Classroom comprising links to information and tutorials on, for 
		example, metadata creation, audio and video recording, and file 
		storage</li>
	<li>Case Studies, which describe how legacy data was processed to create the 
		documentation available in the Exhibit Hall The Exhibit Hall, which 
		displays actual language documentation digitized according to 
		recommended practices </li>
	<li>A Reading Room, which includes links to useful background material</li>
	<li>A Work Room, where users can work on their own documentation using 
		online facilities resident on the LINGUIST List servers</li>
	<li>A Tool Room comprising descriptions of and links to hardware and 
		software facilitating the implementation of best practice </li>
</ul>

<b>Helen Ag&uuml;era, National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Acting Deputy
Director, Division of Preservation and Access</b><br>
<i>Archival projects and the NEH</i>
</p>

<p>
Helen Ag&uuml;era discusses NEH's support for projects related to linguistic
archives.  She describes the range of preservation and access activities
funded by the Endowment through the Division of Preservation and Access. These
activities include: the arrangement and description of a collection of
linguistic materials that needs to be brought under intellectual control; the
digital reformatting of sound and moving image collections for preserving and
enhancing access to linguistic materials; and the creation of online archives
that integrate multiple collections from widely dispersed sources or
repositories to facilitate comparative studies and broad educational use.
</p>
<p>
Ag&uuml;era summarizes the characteristics of successful projects, touching
on what aspects of a proposal NEH evaluators consider essential for
endorsing a project--from information about the language or languages represented
in a project to details about the proposed methodology and adherence to (or
departure from) established standard and best practices.  She gives special
attention to questions concerning the long-term preservation of digital objects. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, Ag&uuml;era also discusses NEH's partnership with the National Science
Foundation, "Documenting Endangered Languages," and the role linguistic archives
can play in this effort to develop and advance knowledge concerning endangered
languages.

<b>Gary Holton, Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC)</b><br>
<i>Ethical practices in language documentation and archiving</i>
</p>

<p>
This paper presents some ethical guidelines for language documentation and
archiving, drawing on experiences at the Alaska Native Language Center archive
and other primary language archives. A clearly defined approach to intellectual
property rights is crucial in order for a language archive to meet its dual
obligations of preservation of and access to language documentation materials.
This point is perhaps most obvious with respect to access: proper access cannot
be achieved unless legal intellectual property responsibilities are met. But
ethical issues are also crucial to preservation efforts. This is because a lack
of clear ethical guidelines may actually impede or inhibit the collection of
documentary material, leading to the potential loss of irreplaceable data.
Creators/authors of endangered language material are reluctant to deposit
materials with a language archive without assurances as to the maintenance of
intellectual property rights. On the other hand, archives have traditionally
been reluctant to accept materials without full legal rights or ownership. Here
we suggest ethical guidelines by which language archives can work in
collaboration with creators of documentary materials to ensure preservation of
materials while respecting restrictions on access to materials imposed by the
creators and by language communities.

<i>Digitizing the Audio Archive of Linguistic Field Work</i>
</p>

<p>
The Berkeley Language Center manages three main and several minor archives of
audio recordings. This presentation focuses on our efforts to digitally preserve
and provide access to the Audio Archive of Linguistic Field Work, which consists
of nearly 1,400 hours of field recordings of Native American languages. We
discuss legal issues regarding copyright and the rights of consultants and
Native American communities, as well as ethical issues surrounding the
preservation and distribution of materials deposited at the BLC long before use
of the Internet. We also address technical issues of archiving and delivery (bit
depth and sampling rates, file formats, backup), and finally, our efforts to
anticipate and comply with metadata standards.

<i>Preparing documentary materials for archiving</i>
</p>

<p>
The Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) at the
University of Texas at Austin is a digital repository of multimedia resources.
Our primary mission is the digitization and preservation of "legacy" materals;
that is, recordings and texts produced in analog media over the past
half-century. We have received a wide variety of materials, with and without
metadata (catalog information). This diversity is unavoidable when dealing with
materials produced long ago, often by someone other than the person who sends us
the package, but it is not particularly desirable.
</p>
<p>
In the course of her duties as manager of AILLA, and from her own
experiences as a field linguist, Johnson has developed a set of guidelines for
corpus management that she hopes will be useful for documentary linguists in the
creation of an orderly, archive-ready, language documentation corpus. This talk
presents those guidelines with examples from AILLA's materials. In the brief
time allowed she touches on the essential elements: documenting consent,
labelling, digital formats, and metadata. More detailed information on all of
these topics and more is available on the web.

<br>
<i>Databases and archiving</i>
</p>

<p>
Many types of linguistic data are highly amenable to being stored in databases,
including, for example, lexical and typological data. Unfortunately, many
commonly-used database programs produce, as a default, resources in proprietary
formats that are not suitable for archiving.
</p>
<p>
However, if appropriate measures are taken, it is possible to use almost any
kind of database software and still create resources which can be archived over
the long term. To do this, it is important to maintain a distinction between at
least two different formats which the data in a database can take on: archival
and working.
</p><p>
An archival format for a database is one which is expected to be readable in
the long term. Typically, it will take on the form of a text file, perhaps one
which uses XML to annotate the data. A working format is typically optimized for
data entry and searching. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with making use
of a working format as long it is regularly exported to an archival format.
</p><p>
In addition to covering basic distinctions in database formats, this talk
discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using common database software
with respect to creating archivable resources.

Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC)</b><br>
<i>Archiving and the work flow of field work</i>
</p>

<p>
Archiving is not something we do at the end of our fieldwork, it is part of
everyday work.  Recent technological advances have pointed to the importance of
planning data management and workflow for ethnographic recording. Recordings
should always be of high quality, but it is in the context of small and
endangered cultures and languages that the quality of recording takes on new
significance (quality here refers both to the content and the form of the
recording). If we are the only recorders of the last remaining speakers or
performers then we are providing historical documents that will be of use not
only to other researchers, but primarily to those recorded and their
descendants. So, right from the moment of recording, we must be concerned with
making good documents which will be placed into a suitable repository for
storage and discovery.
<br>
<br>
In this session we discuss a workflow that builds in development of archival
data. We show that making the initial recordings and their digital
representation citable by means of a persistent identifier allows further work
to be located with reference to that primary data. Further description of the
data with standard metadata terms allows its discovery in the long term.
