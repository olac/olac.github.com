--------------------------------------------------------------------

Date due:  22 November 2002

Return to: joan_spanne@sil.org, olac-admin@language-archives.org

Instructions:

Find the archives you are reviewing in the web page at
http://www.language-archives.org/events/olac02/reviews.html
For each of them, follow the "repository" link.

To answer question 1, review the archive description information
that is presented (out of the Identify response) on this page. The 
standard that describes these fields of information is section 3 of:
   http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/protocol.html

To answer questions 2 through 5, click on the Explore link at the
end of the archive description.  In the Display options on the 
Repository Explorer, click "Both". Then click the List Identifiers
link to generate a list of records. Randomly choose 5 to 8 records
to inspect. 

To inspect a record, click on "[display metadata formats]". Find 
"Prefix=[olac]" in the returned list of formats, and click on
the "display record" link for the Olac format. On the left you will
see a parsed form of the record. Scroll to the right to see the 
actual XML encoding. When you are done looking at this record, hit
the Back button on your browser twice to go back to the record list.

If, instead of getting a display of the record, you get a validation
error report, make note of the error under question 2 on the form.
Then hit the Back button on your browser twice to go back to the 
record list.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "None" 
option under Schema Validation.  Repeat the instructions in the
preceding paragraph for inspecting a record.

For questions 2 and 3 the standard to compare the records against is:
   http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/olacms.html
For question 3, the main guidelines are summarized in:
   http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/olacms_recs.html
   
To complete your review, save the template below to a file named with the
repository id (the word preceding the archive name on the review
assignments page) plus your surname, e.g. "AILLA-Cheng", then mail the
completed form to the addresses listed above.

Thanks,
Joan Spanne, Gary Simons, and Steven Bird.

Archive being reviewed:

Date of review:


1. Is the archive description information satisfactory?  Are any
   fields of information missing?  Can you suggest any improvements?



2. Do you observe any errors in the use of metadata elements (for
   instance, there is a validation error, or the wrong element was 
   chosen for a particular kind of information)?



3. In what ways do the metadata descriptions fall short of what the 
   OLAC metadata guidelines recommend as best practice?



4. Did you observe anything else that could be improved?



5. Did you observe anything about the practices followed in these
   metadata descriptions that stands out as a good example that
   others should take note of? 



6. What feedback do you have for the OLAC guidelines based on this
   review? Is there a best practice recommendation you would suggest
   be added? Was there something in an OLAC document you could not
   understand or did not agree with?
