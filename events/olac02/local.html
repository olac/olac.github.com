<h2>LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS</h2>

<h3>Sheraton University City</h3>

<p>
The Sheraton Hotel is located just two
blocks from IRCS at 36th &amp; Chestnut Streets.
We have reserved a block of rooms for workshop participants
for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights (9th, 10th and 11th).
(We assume most participants will arrive on Monday evening, and
depart on Thursday evening.)

<p>
We have sponsorship to cover three nights for participants
from the US, plus an additional two nights for people travelling
from outside the contiguous United States.
This covers the room rate plus tax, but no extras (e.g. meals).

<p>Extra nights can be purcashed at the discounted rate of US$119, but
please book soon.  (If you need an extra night and need help paying for it,
please contact Steven Bird.)

<p>
<b><font color=green>
All confirmed participants must activate their reservations by calling the
Sheraton hotel, mentioning "OLAC", and specifying the nights
that accomodation is required, and noting the confirmation number you
are given.  You will be asked for a credit card number, which will be used
for any charges unrelated to the room and tax costs (e.g. meals, videos,
nights not covered by the OLAC workshop travel stipulation of 3 or 5 nights).
Please do this as soon as possible.
To see if you are a confirmed participant being supported
by OLAC, please see the participants page.

<h3>Travel: From the Airport</h3>

<P> 
The most cost-effective way is to take an airport shuttle.
In the baggage claim area, go to a ground transportation counter
to see a selection of shuttle services to choose from.
(The Sheraton University Hotel suggests the Lady Liberty Shuttle
Service, tel. 215-724-8888, which charges $8 for a one-way trip
from the Airport to the hotel or to a destination around the Penn
campus.  Dial '27' using the free phone at the Ground Transportation
counter to arrange for a Lady Liberty shuttle.)

<P>
A taxi ride from the Airport to the hotel or the Penn campus costs a
flat rate of $20, and is available 24 hours a day.

<P>
For more information about public transportation from the airport, visit the <A
