         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="archive">Is it required that an OLAC metadata repository describe an
            archive?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>In the prototypical case, a participating institution is an archive that curates
            language resources. In this case, the OLAC metadata repository it implements is a
            catalog of its archival holdings. (Participants that operate such archives can be
            identified by the presence of the <i>&lt;archivalSubmissionPolicy&gt;</i>
            element in the <i>&lt;olac-archive&gt;</i> description that is part of the
            Identify response of their repository.) But operating an archive is not a requirement.
            The mission of OLAC is to create a "worldwide virtual library of language resources" and
            anyone who can contribute useful information to the catalog of known language resources
            is invited to do so. This may include contributions from individuals rather than
            institutions. It may also include metadata repositories that are indexes to language
            resources supplied by others or that describe entry points into an online database of
            language-related information.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="record">What do the records in an OLAC metadata repository represent?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>Each record in an OLAC metadata repository represents a <a
               href="../documents/faq.html#2">language resource</a> that the participating archive
            wants to inform the world about. The resource could be a physical object like a book, a
            CD-ROM, a wax cylinder or a box of unpublished field notes. In such cases, the metadata
            record allows potential users to discover that the resource exists. When the resource is
            a digital object that is posted on the web (such as a document, a corpus of recordings,
            a database or a software program), then the metadata record can go a step further to
            provide access to the resource by supplying the URL in the
               <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element. The record need not describe resource
            that the contributor actually has under archival control. For instance, a record could
            be an annotated bibliography entry in which the contributor has added value to the basic
            citations by supplying a description and subject classification. Or a record could
            describe a web page that is an index page giving links to language resources that are
            posted on other web sites. </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="starting">How do I get started on implementing an OLAC metadata repository?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>An OLAC metadata repository is essentially a set of language resource descriptions. A
            good place to start is to look at the <a
               href="/NOTE/usage.html">OLAC Metadata Usage
               Guidelines</a> to learn how OLAC describes language resources. That document defines
            and illustrates each of the possible elements of a language resource description. It
            will be helpful at the same time to be looking at <a href="#examples">examples of
               complete metadata records</a> from existing OLAC participants. A key decision you
            must make before you can begin implementing is to <a href="#granularity">decide what to
               treat as an individual item</a>. As you are looking at examples from other OLAC
            participants, make note of records that match your situation and which you could use as
            models for resource description in your repository. However, rather than simply using an
            existing record as a template for your own records, you should evaluate it against
            OLAC's <a href="/REC/bpr.html"> best practice
               recommendations for language resource description</a>. In the process you may
            discover ways to improve the quality of the metadata records you will produce. </p>
         <p>Once you have a good idea of what the records in your repository will be like, the next
            step is to read carefully the <a
               href="/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a>
            standard. You will see that it defines two approaches, implementing a static repository
            versus a dynamic repository. You need to <a href="#approaches">decide which kind of
               repository to implement</a>, then focus on the corresponding section of the OLAC
            standard. If you are implementing a static repository, you will want to look at the more
            complete <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm"
               >Specification for an OAI Static Repository</a> which is the standard from the
            digital library community that the OLAC standard is based on. You may also find it
            helpful at this stage to look at <a href="#eg-static">complete examples of static
               repositories</a>. When you are ready to begin implementing, you may follow the
            instructions for <a href="#manual">creating a repository by hand</a> or for using a
            script to <a href="#sample1">generate a repository from a database</a>. </p>
         <p>Similarly, if you are implementing a dynamic repository, you will need to consult the
            complete specification of the <a
               href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm">Open Archives
               Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> and may want to see <a
               href="#eg-dynamic">complete examples of dynamic repositories</a>. When you are ready
            to begin implementing, you will want to start by searching for <a href="#sample2">sample
               code</a> that you can use as a basis for your implementation. </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="granularity">How do I decide what to treat as an individual item?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>The <i>OLAC Repositories</i> standard addresses this issue in a section on <a
               href="/OLAC/repositories.html#Guidelines%20concerning%20relevance%20and%20granularity"
               >Guidelines concerning relevance and granularity</a>. The basic guideline is this: "A
            metadata repository should treat resources with a single provenance as constituting a
            single unit with respect to OLAC metadata and should, therefore, describe them within a
            single record." For published resources, the publication unit typically constitutes the
            appropriate unit for the OLAC metadata record. For unpublished papers presenting
            findings of research, these closely parallel typical published works, and can be treated
            at a comparable level in an OLAC metadata record. For primary source materials (e.g.,
            recordings, transcriptions, annotations, notes, data sets), the typical practice of
            archivists is to gather such materials into collections based on shared provenance—this
            is, based on having a common origin and history. These collections are then the primary
            units for metadata description, resulting in OLAC records of <a
               href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/">DCMI Type</a>
            Collection. See the section on <a
               href="/NOTE/usage.html#Granularity%20of%20resources"
               >Granularity of resources</a> in the <i>OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines</i> for a more
            in-depth discussion of the principle of provenance as applied to collections and
            metadata within the OLAC context.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="database">How do I create records for a web database?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>There are many valuable language resources that are underused because they are part of
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">Deep Web</a> (that is, the portion
            of the Internet that is obscured from discovery by general search engines because the
            resources are in a database that is accessible only via a search interface on its host
            site). Such resources can be brought to the indexable web by creating OLAC records for
            them, since it is a built-in service of OLAC to convert every record into a page that
            gets crawled by web spiders. (To see the set of pages for a given archive, click the <a
               href="/archives.php">Archives</a> link on the OLAC
            home page, click the "More Details" link for the desired archive, and then click the
            "Records in Archive" link on the resulting Archive Details page.) </p>
         <p>The only requirement on a web database for using an OLAC repository to expose and access
            its language resources is that it have publicly accessible URLs for the resources. These
            often involve a base URL that uses parameters to provide arguments to a query. For
            instance, the resources in the <a
               href="/archive/linguistlist.org">LINGUIST List
               Language Resources</a> repository and the <a
               href="/archive/odin.csufresno.edu">ODIN: Online
               Database of Interlinear Text</a> repository are dynamic pages that generate a listing
            of everything held in the database about a particular language; the ISO 639-3 code for
            the language is a parameter to the URL that is given in the
               <i>&lt;dc:identifier&gt;</i> element of each record. (Click the "Records in
            Archive" link on the referenced Archive Details pages to see sample records.) </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="examples">Where can I find good examples of sample metadata records?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>To see the metadata records from a given archive, click the <a
               href="/archives.php">Archives</a> link on the OLAC
            home page, click the "More Details" link for the desired archive, and then click the
            "Records in Archive" link on the resulting Archive Details page. Alternatively, you may
            get to the same place by going to the <a
               href="/archive_records/">List Records from an OLAC
               Archive</a> page, selecting an archive from the dropdown list, and then clicking the
            Submit Query button. When you click on the identifier for a particular item, you will
            see an HTML representation of the metadata. To see the underlying XML format of the OLAC
            metadata record, click on the "OAI-PMH request for OLAC format" link. </p>

            Survey</a> tool may be used to see examples of how individual metadata elements have
            been used throughout the OLAC catalog. Note, however, that many uses do not conform to
            best practice recommendations. A good way to use the tool is to identify ways of using

            often helpful to see these elements in context to get ideas of how best to use them in
            complete metadata records. </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="approaches">How do I decide if I should implement a static repository or a
               dynamic repository?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>There are two basic approaches as laid out in the <a
               href="/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a>
            standard. The first is to build a <i>static repository.</i> In a static repository, the
            entire catalog for the repository is expressed in a single XML file that contains all of
            the metadata records. This is the simpler of the two approaches and can be used when the
            repository is relatively small&#x2014;up to approximately 5,000 records. When there
            is no existing catalog database, the implementer can use an XML editor to <a
               href="#manual">create and maintain a repository by hand</a>. When there is an
            existing catalog database, the implementer can <a href="#sample1">use a script to export
               it</a> to the proper XML format.</p>
         <p>The second approach is to implement a <i>dynamic repository.</i> This approach can be
            used for a catalog of any size, but when the catalog is larger than 5,000 records, it
            becomes necessary to use this approach. In a dynamic repository, the implementer <a
               href="#sample2">writes program code</a> that resides at a base URL on a web site and
            responds to the requests of the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting in order to provide
            dynamic access to information in an existing catalog database. The trickiest part about
            implementing a dynamic repository is that it is necessary to implement flow control
            using a <a href="#tokens">resumption token</a> mechanism in order to ensure that the
            responses to individual protocol requests are not exceedingly large. The OAI community
            considers half a megabyte to be a reasonable response size (which corresponds to about
            500 records in a typical repository).</p>

         <h2>Implementing a static repository</h2>
         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="eg-static">Where can I find complete examples of static repositories?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>The last thing in the <a
               href="/OLAC/repositories.html#Requirements%20on%20static%20repositories"
               >section on static repositories</a> in the <i>OLAC Repositories</i> standard is a
            link to a <a href="/OLAC/1.1/static-repository.xml"
               >complete example</a>. Clicking this link retrieves an XML document which is a
            hypothetical sample repository containing two records. </p>
         <p>It is also possible to see the XML document behind each of the static repositories that
            have been implemented by participating archives. Approximately nine-tenths of the
            repositories are implemented in this way. The XML document for a static repository can
            be retrieved in whole by inspecting its base URL. That URL is found by clicking the <a
               href="/archives.php">Archives</a> link on the OLAC
            home page, then clicking the "More Details" link for the desired archive. Find the line
            that says "Base URL", copy the URL, and paste it into a web browser. If the repository
            is dynamic, the result will be a documentation page or an error response concerning an
            illegal verb. However, in nine-tenths of the cases, the repository is static and the
            result will be the XML document that holds all the contents of the repository.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="manual">How would I create and maintain a static repository by hand?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>For a repository that has only a few records, it is very straightforward to create it
            from scratch using an XML editor. It also makes sense to build and maintain a larger
            repository by hand if there is no existing database for the metadata. In essence, an XML
            editor can be used to create and maintain a static repository as the database. For
            instructions on how to do this, see the OLAC Informational Note on <a
               href="http://olac.googlecode.com/svn/web/NOTE/oxygen.html">Using
               &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor to Create or Validate an OLAC Static
            Repository</a>. &lt;oXygen/&gt; is a mature and full-featured product that
            offers a 30-day free trial and attractive academic pricing ($48 at the time of writing). </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="sample1">Where can I find sample code for generating a static repository from a
               database?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>Follow this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/olac/source/browse/#svn/src/data_providers/ailla_php">link</a>
            to find sample code for generating a static repository. It
         is written in PHP and extracts the metadata from a MySQL
         database.  Another package (written in C) 
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6577&package_id=200507&release_id=439285">converts a BibTeX file</a> to an OLAC
         Static Repository.</p>
         <p>Note that it will not work to supply the URL of your script as the base URL for a static
            repository. While accessing such a URL might return a valid static repository document
            that is up-to-the-minute with respect to the underlying database, this will not work
            correctly with the harvester because the harvesting protocol assumes that a
            static repository is a static  data file. The static repository harvester uses the HTTP protocol to
            issue a HEAD request to determine if the file has changed.
            It reharvests the repository only if the "Last-Modified" time in
            the response is more recent than the time of the last successful harvest. </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="test1">How do I test whether my static repository is valid?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>The <a href="/register/register.php">OLAC Archive
               Registration</a> page provides a service that makes a final test of conformance to
            the <a href="/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC
            Repositories</a> standard before a new repository is admitted to the registration
            process. This same service can be used at any time to test the conformance of a
            repository file, even if you know it is not ready for registration or even if a previous
            version is already registered. There are two cases: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p><i>The repository file is posted on a public web site.</i> If your static
                  repository file has been placed on a publicly accessible web site, then go to the
                     <a href="/register/register.php">OLAC Archive
                     Registration</a> page and paste the URL for your repository file into the first
                  text box on the page. Click the "VALIDATE" button to test the file. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p><i>The repository file is only on your work station.</i> If your static repository
                  file is on your local work station, then go to the <a
                     href="/register/register.php">OLAC Archive
                     Registration</a> page and click the "Browse" button to the right of the second
                  text box on the page. After you have located the repository file, click the
                  "UPLOAD &amp; VALIDATE" button to test the file.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>If the final line of the report says "SUCCESS," then you are ready to proceed to the <a
               href="#register">registration step</a>. On the other hand, if the final line says
            "FAILURE," you still have work to do. Make note of all the individual tests that failed
            and fix the offending content in the repository; then repeat the validation process. In
            the case of failing to pass an XML Schema Validation test, click on the "error logs"
            link to see the list of errors generated by the validator. The two validators report the
            errors differently, so look at both logs to get a fuller idea of what is wrong. Before
            the job is finished, you will also want to test some of your records for metadata
            quality; see below on how to <a href="#quality">improve the quality of the metadata</a>
            in your repository.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="publish">Where do I put my repository when it is ready to publish?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>There are two options. The first option is to post the XML file for your static
            repository on a public web site, such as the site run by your repository's host
            institution. Ideally you will want it where you have write access, since you will want
            to be able to update the repository from time to time. Once your repository is posted
            for public access, you are ready to <a href="#register">register with OLAC</a>. </p>
         <p>If you do not have access to a public web site, the second option is to let OLAC host
            your static repository. If you choose this option, the uploading is done as part of the
            registration process so you are ready to proceed to <a href="#register">registering with
               OLAC</a>.</p>

         </h3>
         <p>Only about one-tenth of the OLAC repositories are implemented in this way. Two of them,

               href="http://www.ethnologue.com/sil_archives2.asp">SIL Language and Culture

            testing all the verbs of the harvesting protocol with various combinations of
            parameters, including combinations that should generate error responses. You may
            experience a sample implementation and get a better feel for how the protocol works by
            clicking on one of the above links and trying the various links on the documentation
            page. The text of each link gives the complete parameter string that is appended to the
            Base URL to form a full URL. Clicking the link will retrieve the XML document which the
            dynamic repository returns as the response to the request. The full request URL will
            show in the location box of your browser. Click the browser's Back button to go back to

         </h3>
         <p>A best practice that has been suggested within the OAI
            community is to implement <i>Document</i> as an additional
            verb that provides a human-readable
            documentation page. The base URL of your dynamic repository
            (with no request parameters) can then be redirected to
            <i>?verb=Document</i>. OLACA 
            (the OLAC Aggregator) is implemented in this way. It is
            recommended that you begin your development by
            making a copy of the 
            <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/cgi-bin/olaca3.pl?verb=Document">OLACA documentation page</a>
             and changing
            it to match your situation. 
            (Be sure to set the &lt;BASE> tag with
            your base URL up to the script name so that the HREFs can
            simply begin with the script name.)
            The page contains a sample
            link to test
            each significant case of each protocol verb, including all the
            error conditions. As you are developing and debugging your
            repository, a
            first level of testing can be done by clicking these links to
            manually test the calls and examine the resulting XML responses. 
            
         </p>
         <p>When you are satisfied with the results you are getting,
            the next step is to try the more formal tests at 
            the <a
               href="http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/cgi-bin/Explorer/2.0-1.46/addarchive">Open
               Archives Initiative - Repository Explorer</a>. After
            entering the base URL of your repository, this tool
            will put it through a battery of tests as well as provide
            a web interface that will allow you to query and explore your
            repository. When your repository passes all the tests of
            the OAI protocol, then you are ready to proceed to the
            OLAC validation and registration process which is
            described under the next question.</p>

         <p>OLAC has defined <a href="/REC/bpr.html">best practice
               recommendations for language resource description</a>. You should review a few
            records from your repository against this list of recommendations to see if there are
            things you could change in the implementation of your repository (or of the underlying
            database on which it is based) to follow even more of the recommendations. It is not

            and click the "Analyze" button. If the format of the record is not valid, the resulting
            page will report the errors. Otherwise, the resulting page shows an analysis of the
            record. The bottom part of the page gives the metadata quality score along with
            recommendations on changes that would improve the score. It is possible to click the
            browser's Back button to return to the record entry form, edit the record to make
            changes that you think will improve the quality score, and then click "Analyze" again to
            test the result.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="update">What do I do when I want to update the information in my
            repository?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>If the repository is hosted on your own site (whether it is static or dynamic), simply
            update it on your site. There is no need to inform OLAC. As long as the repository is at
            the same base URL, it will be harvested on the regular schedule (explained in next
            answer) and your updates will be automatically uploaded into the database at that time.</p>
         <p>If it is a static repository that is hosted on the OLAC site, then you must use the
            registration service to upload the new version. Go to the <a
               href="/register/register.php">OLAC Archive
               Registration</a> page and click the "Browse" button to the right of the second text
            box on the page. After you have located the revised repository file on your hard disk,
            click the "UPLOAD &amp; VALIDATE" button to upload the file. This will also test the
            file for conformance to the <a
               href="/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC Repositories</a>
            standard. If there are problems, you will be notified and instructed to correct the
            problems and repeat the process. If the validation is successful, you will be offered an
            option to replace the existing repository with the new one. When you select that option,
            a confirmation request will be sent to the adminEmail declared in the original
            repository. Once the request is confirmed, the repository will be replaced with the new
            file. </p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="changes">Why aren't my changes being harvested?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>Incremental harvesting takes place every day. Before issuing the <tt>ListRecords</tt>
            command of the OAI-PMH protocol, the harvester looks up the date of the last successful
            harvest of the repository and adds that date as the value of the <tt>from</tt>
            parameter. All records with an <tt>oai:datestamp</tt> in their header that is equal to
            or later than that date will be returned by the data provider and uploaded by the
            harvester. In the case of a static repository, it requires two harvesting cycles to
            propagate updates &#x2014; the first harvesting request following an update fails
            because the static repository gateway recognizes that it must refresh its cache of
            records; thus by the next request the gateway is able to respond with the updated
            records.</p>
         <p>If more than two days have elapsed since you updated your repository, and the changes
            you made are not showing when you go to <a
               href="/archive_records/"
               >http://www.language-archives.org/archive_records/</a> to inspect your records, then
            look at the <a href="/archives.php">Participating
               Archives</a> page to see if your repository is successfully harvesting. There are two
            possible cases: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>If the end of the line for your repository shows a red X, then the last harvest
                  failed. (Click on "More Details"; you will see the date of the last successful
                  harvest near the bottom of the page.) Failure to harvest means that your base URL
                  is not accessible or that your repository has a serious validation problem; enter
                  your base URL into the <a
                     href="/register/register.php">registration</a>
                  page to generate a validation report.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>If the end of the line for your repository shows a light green check mark, then it
                  is harvesting successfully. The reason for failure to update is likely to be the
                  datestamps in the record headers. Remember that the datestamp is the revision date
                  for the metadata record, not for the resource it describes. Thus if the datestamp
                  is not updated to the current date when a record is updated, it will not be picked
                  up by an incremental harvest. The remedy is to update the datestamps.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>As a guard against failure to update datestamps, a complete reharvest of every
            repository is performed approximately monthly. The date of full harvesting for any given
            repository cannot be predicted exactly since the scheduling algorithm is dynamic
            &#x2014; using randomization to spread the load across the month and recalibrating
            priorities when a particular repository fails to harvest. This reharvest takes care of
            another problem, namely, the purging of deleted records. In a dynamic repository it is
            possible to specify <tt>status="deleted"</tt> on a record and the incremental harvest
            will delete it from the database. However, static repositories do not support deletion.
            Therefore, any record that is deleted from a static repository will persist in the OLACA
            database for up to one month until the monthly reharvest is performed.</p>

         <h3 class="Question">
            <a name="move">How do I move my repository to a different base URL?</a>
         </h3>
         <p>If you want to move the base URL for your repository (without changing the repository
            identifier), you must re-register. Go to the <a
               href="/register/register.php">registration</a> page,
            enter your new base URL, and click the Validate button. If there are no validation
            errors, you will be presented with a "Change Registration" button. Clicking it will move
            your repository to the new base URL. If you also want to change the repository
            identifier, then you must contact the OLAC administrators who will manually remove your
            existing repository and registration, and then instruct you to register the new
            repository.</p>
