<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
The purpose of a keywords search facility over OLAC data is to provide a
simplified means of finding information, without requiring a user to 
have knowledge of the underlying database (metadata) structure. The ordering
of matching records is based upon a system of ranking metadata according to
its observance of best practice guidelines, as well as statistics about the
usage of metadata tags in records across all OLAC metadata.
</p>

<h2><a name="Matching_Records"></a>2. Matching records</h2>
<p>
The keyword search uses exact word matching using a fulltext index on metadata
tag content, substring matching across metadata content, soundex 
values for approximate string matching and Ethnologue data providing 
information on alternate language names.
</p>

<h4><a name="Exact_Word_Matching"></a>2.1 Exact Word Matching</h4>
<p>
The default behaviour of the search is to match exact words in the search
string and to return records which contain all words, using a fulltext index
on the content of metadata elements.
</p>

<h4><a name="Substring_Matching"></a>2.2 Substring Matching</h4>
<p>
This search performs a substring search across all content from any metadata
element.
</p>

<h4><a name="Phrase_Matching"></a>2.3 Phrase Matching</h4>
<p>
Where there are multiple words in a query string, phrase matching only returns
records which contain the query string with no tokenizing. This also uses
simple substring matching.
</p>
<h4><a name="Ethnologue_Data"></a>2.4 Ethnologue Data</h4>
<p>
If the search string is a language or country name, this is detected (by use
of the Ethnologue data on alternate language and dialect names) and the user
is presented with links to launch queries related to that language or country. 
Where the original search is for a language name, a link is available to view 
records which use an alternate name for that language or records which provide
information on a dialect of the originally searched language. Similarly, if
the original search string is a country name, a list of languages which are 
spoken in that country can be viewed. Recognising language and country names 
allows a link to the Ethnologue entry on that search term to be presented where 
relevant.
</p>
<p>
[This functionality may make the assumption that these are the two most 
likely/popular types of search on a linguistic database]
</p>

<h4><a name="Soundex_Approximate_Matching"></a>
	2.5 Soundex Approximate Matching</h4>
<p>
When a search yields no matches, the aim is to minimize mouse clicks to find
information on either correct spellings of the search term, or information
on topics related to the original search.
</p>
<p>
Where there are no matching records found in the database, the query string
is first checked to determine whether it is a language name. If it is the case
that there are no records about an input language name, it is assumed to be 
more helpful to present alternate names for the language, rather than similarly 
spelt words.
</p>
<p>
Where this is not the case, similiarly spelt words are suggested to the user. 
These words are retrieved from a table of words and their soundex values, the 
vocabulary consisting of all distinct words found in the content of all OLAC 
metadata elements. The table is indexed on the soundex value, to provide faster 
lookup. The words with soundex equal to that of the search term are retrieved 
and sorted according to their levenshtein edit distance from the search term. 
Similarly, language names from the Ethnologue tables which have identical 
soundex values are ranked by levenshtein distance and displayed as possible 
corrections to the original query string. Again, this separation of similarly 
spelt words and similarly spelt language names makes an assumption that 
language names are most frequently searched.
</p>

<h2><a name="Metadata_Ranking"></a>3. Metadata Ranking</h2>
<p>
The scoring of metadata is used in results ordering and for generating Archive
Report Cards on metadata quality. The scoring of metadata takes into account
the usage of tags across all archives and the code usage within records.
</p>

<h4><a name="Tag_Usage_Statistics"></a>
	 3.1 Tag Usage Statistics</h4>
<p>
In determining which tags are most used, each tag is ranked by the percentage 
of records which contain that tag at least once. This percentage is converted 
into a score from 0 to 3.
<p>
The information gained from this survey was used to choose the most suitable
tag information to display as a summary of matching records. Also, these 
percentages were used to discover tags which ought to be used in order to
enhance metadata quality. For this reason, the information gained here is used
in scoring metadata.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="quantAnalysis.php">quantAnalysis.php</a> for tag usage statistics.

<h4><a name="Metadata_Quality"></a>3.2 Metadata Quality</h4>

<p>
The quality of metadata is assessed against best practice guidelines as at
<a href="/REC/olac-extensions.html">
http://www.language-archives.org/REC/olac-extensions.html</a> as well as the
existence of certain XML tags according to their usage statistics. Each item
receives a score between 0 and 10, used for results ordering.
</p>

<p>
For each tag which has an associated extension code from a controlled
vocabulary, one point is scored if a code attribute is used. This is converted
into a proportion of tags which use codes against the total tags in a record
which have an associated controlled vocabulary.
</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Code exists score = 
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	( Number of elements containing code attributes )
	/ ( Number of elements in the record of type with associated code )
<br /><br />

<p>
This returns a fraction of code usage between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
Points are deducted when a record does not contain any instances of tags which
are deemed important to any metadata record. The following tags have been
deemed necessary in every record based upon tag usage:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>title</li>
		<li>description</li>
		<li>subject</li>
		<li>date</li>
		<li>identifier</li>
	</ul>
<p>
For each of these tags which is absent, a score of (1/5) is deducted from the
record score. This implies equal weighting of the deduction of points for
absence of any of the core tags.
</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Tag absent deductions =
<br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
( Number of core tags absent ) / ( Number of core tags )

<p> This results in a score between 0 and 1.
<p>
These scores are then weighted:
<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Score = 10 * ( (1/1) * (code exists score) - (1/5) * (tag absent deductions) )

<br /><br />
to return an integer score out of 10 for each record. These scores are held in 
a table relating each item to a score out of 10. At the time of searching, this
score is combined with the tag usage score to order search results.
</p>
<p>

for a summary of record quality scores across OLAC archives.

<h4><a name="Results_Ordering">3.3 Results Ordering</h4>

<p>
Records which match the search term are grouped together according to their
archive. The ordering of the archives depends upon the metadata 
quality and the number of matching records from that archive.
</p>
<p>
The score of a matched record is given by:
<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Score = (5/10) * (record quality out of 10)
<br /><br />
converted into a rating out of five stars for display. [Use of the tag usage
rank of the tag containing the matching term could be introduced in order
to rank more highly records which contain the matched term in more popular
fields.]
</p>
<p>
These record scores are aggregated for each archive, and the archives with
matching records are ordered based on this aggregate quality score.
</p>

<h2><a name="To_Do_List"></a>4. To Do List</h2>
<ul>
<li> Allow use of boolean operators or similar (eg, + or quoting phrases) in 
search strings.</li>
<li>Revise metadata quality assessment.</li>
<li>Integrate substring and exact word searching and use exact word matches
as a means of results ranking.</li>
<li>Allow user to tailor the method of ranking records for results ordering.
</li>
</ul>
