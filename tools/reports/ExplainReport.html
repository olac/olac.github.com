<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document explains the statistical information contained in the Archive
Report Cards, generated by <a href="archiveReportCard.php">
archiveReportCard.php</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="Star_Rating"></a>2. Star Rating</h2>
<p>
The archive star rating is a representation of the average item score for
the archive. It is caluculated:
<br /> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;
	round( (Average item score out of 10)/2 )
<br /><br />
to give a star rating out of five.

</p>

<h2><a name="Archive_Diversity"></a>3. Archive Diversity</h2>
<p>
For the subject and type fields, these percentages show:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Diversity = (Distinct code values / Number instances of element) * 100
<br /><br />
This gives an indication of the diversity of the information held by the
archive.
</p>

<h2><a name="Metadata_Quality"></a>4. Metadata Quality</h2>
<p>
Graph showing the frequency of record scores within the archive.
</p>

<p>
The quality of metadata is assessed against best practice guidelines as at
<a href="/REC/olac-extensions.html">
http://www.language-archives.org/REC/olac-extensions.html</a> as well as the
existence of certain XML elements according to their usage statistics. Each item
receives a score between 0 and 10, used for results ordering.
</p>
<p>
The scoring of metadata is contained in the source file metadataScoring.php.
</p>
<p>
For each element which has an associated extension code from a controlled
vocabulary, one point is scored if a code attribute is used. This is converted
into a proportion of elements which use codes against the total elements 
in a record which have an associated controlled vocabulary.
</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Code exists score = 
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	( Number of elements containing code attributes )
	/ ( Number of elements in the record of type with associated code )
<br /><br />

<p>
This returns a fraction of code usage between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
Points are deducted when a record does not contain any instances of elements
which are deemed important to any metadata record. The following elements
have been deemed necessary in every record based upon element usage:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>title</li>
		<li>description</li>
		<li>subject</li>
		<li>date</li>
		<li>identifier</li>
	</ul>
<p>
For each of these elements which is absent, a score of (1/5) is deducted from the
record score. This implies equal weighting of the deduction of points for
absence of any of the core elements.
</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Element absent deductions =
<br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
( Number of core elements absent ) / ( Number of core elements )

<p> This results in a score between 0 and 1.
<p>
These scores are then weighted:
<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Score = 10 * ( (1/1) * (code exists score) - (1/5) * (element absent deductions) )

<br /><br />
to return an integer score out of 10 for each record. These scores are held in 
a table relating each item to a score out of 10. At the time of searching, this
score is combined with the element usage score to order search results.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="archiveReportCard.php">archiveReportCard.php</a>
for a summary of record quality scores across OLAC archives.
