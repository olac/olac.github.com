INSTALLATION
----------------

  1. Set up the OLAC harvester (available from olac.sf.net) to store data in 
	a MySQL database.

  2. Change the value of $dbName on line 7 of ./search/lib/olacdb.php to name 
	of the OLAC database. 
	
     Change $username, $password and $hostname on lines 9 to 11 of 
	./search/lib/olacdb.php to the appropriate values for connecting to 
	the OLAC database.

     Change $URLBASE in ./search/searchInclude.php on line 2 to the base URL of
	the directory where the files in search/ are stored. 

  3. Create Ethnologue tables:

	Move the following files into the database directory:
		LanguageIndex.tab
		LanguageCodes.tab
		ChangeHistory.tab
		CountryCodes.tab

	Then run:
	mysql> source ./search/lib/ethnologue.sql
	
		[ NOTE: 
			The .tab files need to reside in the database directory
			for the above command to work.
			Else, make all files readable by all and submit each
			command below using full file names

		mysql> source ethnologueTables.sql
		mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "ChangeHistory.tab" INTO TABLE
        		ChangeHistory(LangID, Action, Date, Description);

		mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "LanguageCodes.tab" 
			INTO TABLE LanguageCodes;

		mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "LanguageIndex.tab" 
			INTO TABLE LanguageIndex;

		mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "CountryCodes.tab" 
			INTO TABLE CountryCodes;
		]

  4. Create Google, soundex and ranking tables:

	To create and populate the Google search term table, run:
	?> php lib/createGoogleTable.php
	
	To create the soundex and ranking tables:
	mysql> source lib/searchTables.sql

		[ Creates the tables:
			SOUNDEX_TABLE
			TAG_USAGE
			ITEM_SCORES
			LanguageSoundex - and populates with soundex values

		  Creates the indices:
			SOUNDEX_INDEX on SOUNDEX_TABLE
			LangSoundexIndex on LanguageSoundex
			METADATA_ELEM_INDEX_CONTENT - FULLTEXT index 
					       on METADATA_ELEM_MYISAM(Content)
		]

  5. Populate soundex and ranking tables:

	Run the following scripts found in lib:
	?> php createTagUsageTable.php
	?> php createSoundexTable.php
	?> php createItemScoresTable.php
			[ depends on metadataScoring.php ]

	These scripts can be set to run at the time of harvesting to update
	the tables which search.php depends upon.

	The createSoundexTable.php script is very expensive to run, as it looks
	through all of the content tags in the database. Since the
	probability of finding new distinct words in newly harvested
	records is low with a large database, this script may not need to be
	run after every harvest.


  6. If moving the lib directory, change the value of LIB in 
	search/searchInclude.php to the new path of the lib directory. 
	
	Similarly, to move the 'style' directory, change $STYLE
	in search/searchInclude.php.
