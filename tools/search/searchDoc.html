<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
The purpose of a keywords search facility over OLAC data is to provide a
simplified means of finding information, without requiring a user to 
have knowledge of the underlying database (metadata) structure. The ordering
of matching records is based upon a system of ranking metadata according to
its observance of best practice guidelines, as well as statistics about the
usage of metadata tags in records across all OLAC metadata.
</p>

<h2><a name="Matching_Records"></a>2. Matching records</h2>
<p>
The keyword search uses exact word matching using a fulltext index on metadata
tag content, soundex 
values for approximate string matching and Ethnologue data providing 
information on alternate language names.
</p>

<h4><a name="Exact_Word_Matching"></a>2.1 Exact Word Matching</h4>
<p>
The default behaviour of the search is to match exact words in the search
string and to return records which contain all words, using a fulltext index
on the content of metadata elements.
</p>

<h4><a name="Ethnologue_Data"></a>2.2 Ethnologue Data</h4>
<p>
If the search string is a language or country name, this is detected (by use
of the Ethnologue data on alternate language and dialect names) and the user
is presented with links to launch queries related to that language or country. 
Where the original search is for a language name, a link is available to view 
records which use an alternate name for that language or records which provide
information on a dialect of the originally searched language. Similarly, if
the original search string is a country name, a list of languages which are 
spoken in that country can be viewed. Recognising language and country names 
allows a link to the Ethnologue entry on that search term to be presented where 
relevant.
</p>
<p>
[This functionality may make the assumption that these are the two most 
likely/popular types of search on a linguistic database]
</p>

<h4><a name="Soundex_Approximate_Matching"></a>
	2.3 Soundex Approximate Matching</h4>
<p>
When a search yields no matches, the aim is to minimize mouse clicks to find
information on either correct spellings of the search term, or information
on topics related to the original search.
</p>
<p>
Where there are no matching records found in the database, the query string
is first checked to determine whether it is a language name. If it is the case
that there are no records about an input language name, it is assumed to be 
more helpful to present alternate names for the language, rather than similarly 
spelt words.
</p>
<p>
Where this is not the case, similiarly spelt words are suggested to the user. 
These words are retrieved from a table of words and their soundex values, the 
vocabulary consisting of all distinct words found in the content of all OLAC 
metadata elements. The table is indexed on the soundex value, to provide faster 
lookup. The words with soundex equal to that of the search term are retrieved 
and sorted according to their levenshtein edit distance from the search term. 
Similarly, language names from the Ethnologue tables which have identical 
soundex values are ranked by levenshtein distance and displayed as possible 
corrections to the original query string. Again, this separation of similarly 
spelt words and similarly spelt language names makes an assumption that 
language names are most frequently searched.
</p>

<h2><a name="Metadata_Ranking"></a>3. Metadata Ranking</h2>
<p>
The scoring of metadata is used in results ordering, taking into account
the usage of tags across all archives and the code usage within records.
</p>
<p>
Please see the
<a href="/tools/reports/ExplainReport.html">
documentation of the archive report cards</a> for details
of the metadata quality formula.
</p>


<h4><a name="Results_Ordering">3.1 Results Ordering</h4>

<p>
Records which match the search term are grouped together according to their
archive. The ordering of the archives depends upon the metadata 
quality and the number of matching records from that archive.
</p>
<p>
The score of a matched record is given by:
<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Score = (5/10) * (record quality out of 10)
<br /><br />
converted into a rating out of five stars for display. [Use of the tag usage
rank of the tag containing the matching term could be introduced in order
to rank more highly records which contain the matched term in more popular
fields.]
</p>
<p>
These record scores are aggregated for each archive, and the archives with
matching records are ordered based on this aggregate quality score.
