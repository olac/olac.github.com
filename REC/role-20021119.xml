      <p>Each term of the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the
    following subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is
    to be used as the value of the <i>code</i> attribute of the <i>Creator</i>
    or <i>Contributor</i> metadata element <cit>OLAC-MS</cit>. Under the heading, 
    the term is described in four ways. <i>Name</i> gives a descriptive label for the term.
    <i>Definition</i> is a one-line summary of what the term means. <i>Comments</i>
    offers more details on what the term represents, and may also include examples
    given to illustrate how the term is meant to be applied.</p>

          <p>Should this refer only to someone who creates a <i>single</i> resource with multiple
                    parts, such as a book of short stories, or can it be used to identify a person who
                    produces a corpus of resources, which are probably archived separately?</p>
        </comment>
        <examples><p>A compiler of a book of short stories or a CD with several songs on it; 
          a collector of a corpus of recordings in some language or on a given topic;

        <comment>
          <p>This term is commonly used by field linguists for the native speakers who work with
          them in describing and analyzing a language.  They contribute their expertise in their
          native language to the resource, although their speech, sign, or writing may not appear 
          directly in  the resource.</p>

        contribute substantially to its content.</definition>
        <comment>
          <p>This role is intended for minor participants such as audience members, whose voices 
          may be heard on a recording saying things like "oh, really".  These interlocutors need not have been
                    physically present.  They could be participants in some form of long-distance
                    communication, such as lurkers in an online discussion.</p>
        </comment>
      </term>
      <term>
        <code>performer</code>
        <name>Performer</name>
        <definition>The participant performed some portion of a recorded, filmed, or transcribed resource.</definition>
        <comment>
          <p>Performers differ from Speakers in that a performance is generally a planned, learned,
          or traditional work, defined in advance in terms of content or style.  The performer
          delivers a rendition of this work, which may be performed by others at other times.
          The distinction between Performer and Speaker is subtle, being based on a subjective
          evaluation of the content of the resource.</p>
        </comment>
        <examples><p>A narrator of a traditional myth; a person performing a ceremony or 
          delivering an oration or a sermon; native speakers recreating a traditional genre of 
          speech, such as ritual greetings or insults; a singer or musician.

      <term>

        presents interim or final results from the participant's research.</definition>

      <term>
        <code>respondent</code>
        <name>Respondent</name>

                results of which study form the basis of the resource.</definition>
      </term>
      <term>
        <code>speaker/signer</code>
        <name>Speaker/Signer</name>
        <definition>The participant was a principal speaker/signer in a resource that consists of a
                recording, a film, or a  transcription of a recorded resource.</definition>
        <comment>
          <p>Speakers/signers are those whose voices/gestures predominate in a recorded or filmed 
          resource. (This resource may be a transcription of that recording.) They differ from 
          Performers in that the speech/sign that is recorded in the resource was not necessarily 
          planned or learned in advance. Note that this distinction is based on the origin and
          content of the resource, and not on specific activities of the participant.</p>
        </comment>
        <examples>
          <p>Participants in a recorded conversation, elicitation session, or informal 
          narration would be termed Speaker/Signers.  Audience members who do not participate 
          beyond the occasional backchannel would be termed Participants.</p>
