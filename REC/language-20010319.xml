      <heading>Introduction</heading> 
      <p>Language identification is an important dimension of language resource
        classification. However, the character-string representation of language names
        is problematic for several reasons: </p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> 
          <p>Different languages (in different parts of the world) may have the
            same name.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>The same language may have a different name in each country where
            it is spoken.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>Within the same country, the preferred name for a language may
            change over time.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>In the early history of discovering new languages (before names
            were standardized), different people referred to the same language by different
            names.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>For languages having non-Roman orthographies, the language name
            may have several possible romanizations.</p> 
        </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>The sum of these facts taken together suggests that a standard based
        on names will not work. Rather, what is needed is a standard based on unique
        identifiers that do not change, combined with accessible documentation that
        clarifies the particular speech variety denoted by each identifier. </p> 
      <p>The information technology community has a standard for language
        identification, namely, ISO 639 <cit>ISO-639</cit>. Part 1 of this standard
        lists two-letter codes for identifying about 140 of the world's major
        languages; part 2 of the standard lists three-letter codes for identifying
        about 400 languages. ISO 639 in turn forms the core of another standard, RFC
        3166 <cit>RFC-3166</cit> (formerly RFC 1766 <cit>RFC-1766</cit>), which is the
        standard used for language identification in the xml:lang attribute of XML and
        in the language element of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. RFC 3166
        provides a mechanism for users to register new language identification codes
        for languages not covered by ISO 639, but very few additional languages have
        been registered. </p> 
      <p>Unfortunately, the existing standard falls far short of meeting the
        needs of the language resources community since it fails to account for more
        than 90% of the world's languages, and it fails to adequately document what
        languages the codes refer to <cit>Simons-2000</cit>. However, SIL's Ethnologue
        <cit>Ethnologue</cit> provides a complete system of language identifiers which
        is openly available on the Web. OLAC will employ the RFC 3166 extension
        mechanism which permits Ethnologue codes to be incorporated. </p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <heading>Ethnologue codes</heading> 
      <p>The SIL Ethnologue <cit>Ethnologue</cit> provides some 6,800
        three-letter codes, along with detailed information about language names,
        genetic affiliations and geographical locus, amongst other things. </p> 
      <p>There are at least three ways to determine the Ethnologue code for a
        given language: </p> 
      <ol> 
        <li> 
          <p>Use the form interface provided on the Ethnologue site
            <cit>Ethnologue</cit>,</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>Use the LDC's temporary Ethnologue query form, giving simpler
            output <cit>LDC-Ethnologue</cit>,</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>Download an ASCII table of language codes
            <cit>Language-Codes</cit>, and load them into a relational database using the schema provided
            in <cit>Simons-2000</cit>.</p> 
        </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p>A three-letter Ethnologue code <tt>AAA</tt> will be represented
        as<tt>x-sil-AAA</tt>.</p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <heading>Other RFC 1766 codes</heading> 
      <p>Other RFC 1766 language codes, such as "en" (English) and "en-us" (US
        English) may be used, however the Ethnologue codes are identified as OLAC Best
        Practice. </p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <heading>Languages for which codes are not assigned</heading> 
      <p>The SIL Ethnologue only covers living and recently extinct languages,
        and no language codes currently exist for ancient languages (e.g. Akkadian),
        for proto-languages (e.g. Proto-Bantu) or more recent precursors of current
        languages (e.g. Middle English). Until a coding system is devised, these
        languages should be identified by their conventional name(s). </p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <heading>Mapping to unqualified Dublin Core</heading> 
      <p>An OLAC data provider should support a standardized method for
        representing OLAC metadata in unqualified Dublin Core. For language
        identifiers, the procedure is as follows: </p> 
      <ol> 
        <li> 
          <p>Drop the language refinement of the subject element and prepend
            "Language: " to the content.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>If there is an identifier but no content, look up the language
            name using the controlled vocabulary server to get a human-readable string, and
            make that the content.</p> 
        </li> 
        <li> 
          <p>Drop the identifier attribute and append its value, parenthesized,
            to the content.</p> 
        </li> 
      </ol> 
    </section> 
  </body> 
  <todo> 
    <p>Create an official controlled vocabulary server for the Ethnologue. </p>
