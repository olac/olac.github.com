         <p> This document specifies the codes, or controlled vocabulary, for the Discourse Type
            extension of the OLAC Type element. These codes describe the content of a resource as

         <p> The Discourse Type extension of the Type element is used to describe the content of a
            resource as representing discourse of a particular structural type. It will typically be
            used when the resource is itself an object of study, as, for example, when the resource
            is a primary text. So it will usually occur in conjunction with the Linguistic Data Type
            extension. For example, a narrative text would be described as both a primary text (OLAC
            Linguistic Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type). </p>

         <heading>Discourse Type</heading>

         <p> Each term in the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the following
            subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is to be used as the
            value of the code attribute of the "OLAC-Discourse-Type" extension of the Type metadata
            element <cit>OLAC-MS</cit>. Under the heading, the term is described in four ways. Name
            gives a descriptive label for the term. Definition is a one-line summary of what the
            term means. Comments offers more details on what the term represents. Examples may also
            be given to illustrate how the term is meant to be applied. </p>
