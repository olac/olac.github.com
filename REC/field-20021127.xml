<section> 
<heading>Introduction</heading> 
<p> The Linguistic Field extension of the Subject Element is used to describe 
  the content of a resource as relevant to a particular subfield of linguistic 
  science. In many cases, it may be that more than one subfield is relevant; in 
  such cases, all relevant subfields should be chosen. Like other OLAC descriptors, 
  the Linguistic Field descriptor is both optional and repeatable.</p>
<p> Every effort has been made to correlate the OLAC Linguistic Field definitions 
  with current practice in the linguistics community. However, in some cases, 
  the definition may be wider or narrower than some linguists might expect. For 
  example, 'Applied Linguistics' may be narrower, as it applies only to linguistic 
  applications in the classroom, and 'Semantics' might be wider, encompassing 
  as it does Lexical Semantics. Where the OLAC definition is narrower, there will 
  be another, more appropriate subfield for the residual meaning, so, for example, 
  'Computational Linguistics' is more appropriate than 'Applied Linguistics' for 
  computer applications. </p>
</section> <section> <heading>Linguistic Field</heading> 
<p> Each term in the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the following 
subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is to be used 
as the value of the code attribute of the Subject metadata element when the xsi:type 
attribute is "OLAC:linguistic-field" <cit>OLAC-MS</cit>. Under the heading, the 
term is described in four ways. Name gives a descriptive label for the term. Definition 
is a one-line summary of what the term means. Comments offers more details on 
what the term represents. Examples may also be given to illustrate how the term 
is meant to be applied. </p>

  <code>language_acquisition</code>

  <name>Language Acquisition</name>

<definition>The study of the process of language acquisition.</definition>
<comment> 
Language Acquisition may be used to describe materials relating to either adult or child
language acquisition, and to either first or later language acquisition.  However, if the materials deal specifically
with language teaching, or with the process of language learning from a pedagogical point of view, they may
be best classified as Applied Linguistics.
</comment>
<examples>
<p>
Studies of first language acquisition, audio or video tapes of language acquisition
experiments, and guides to experimental techniques in eliciting acquisition data.

<code>language_description</code> 
<name>Language Description</name> 
<definition>
The report and/or analysis of data from a language, usually previously uncirculated.
</definition>
<comment><p>
Usually, the major purpose of resources classified as Language Description is to 
provide information on language structure, rather than to critique or support a specific
linguistic theory.  However, if a descriptive drammar or analysis has a particular 
theoretical bent it may also be classified under Linguistic Theory.
