    <abstract>
      <p>Access is an attribute of the Rights element.  It provides a broad classification of
      the ways in which a resource may be used.  Users may have to seek more detailed information
      about a given resource, if Access = restricted, or if they wish to use the resource in
      a non-standard fashion.  Users are always advised to review the specific policies of the
      data provider before making use any resource.
      If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions can be made about the status of these and 
      other rights with respect to the resource.</p>

    <heading>Introduction</heading>
     <p>The information in the Rights element is intended as a guide for potential users of
      the resource. Since intellectual property rights laws and customs can be expected to vary widely across countries 
      and within sub-communities, data providers must make individual arrangements concerning 
      the rights that control access to and use of their resources. A controlled vocabulary can 
      only provide a coarse classification of the types of use to which a resource may be put.  
      Details of the rights and restrictions associated with the resource, such as a copyright
      notice or reference to the specific policies of a data provider, should be specified
      in the element content.</p>

    <heading>Access</heading>
    <p>Each term of the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the
    following subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is
    to be used as the value of the <i>Access</i> attribute of the <i>Rights</i>
    metadata element <cit>OLAC-MS</cit>. Under the heading, the term is described in four ways. 
    <i>Name</i> gives a descriptive label for the term.
    <i>Definition</i> is a one-line summary of what the term means. <i>Comments</i>
    offers more details on what the term represents, and may also include examples
    given to illustrate how the term is meant to be applied.</p>

    <term>
      <code>restricted</code>
      <name>Restricted</name>
      <definition>Access to the resource is restricted.</definition>
      <comment>
      <p>The specific nature of the restriction is not defined by means of a controlled
      vocabulary. Data providers should supply a brief description in the Rights element content.</p>

      <examples>
      <eg>
      &lt;rights xsi:type="olac:access" code="restricted">Permission from the depositor is required.&lt;/rights> 
      </eg>
      </examples>
    </term>
    <term>
      <code>standard</code>
      <name>Standard</name>
      <definition>Access to the resource is standard.</definition>
      <comment>
        <p>Standard access means that the resource can be used like any published work (book, article,
        music cd, etc.); that is, standard laws and policies governing the fair use of the work apply.
        Such policies generally prohibit wholesale incorporation of the resource into another work or 
        copying and distribution of the resource.  They generally allow quotation of small portions 
        of the resource, and summaries, critiques, or analyses, provided that the resource is properly
        cited.</p>
      </comment>
    </term>
    <term>
      <code>non-profit</code>
      <name>Non-profit</name>
      <definition>The resource can be used for any non-profit purpose.</definition>
      <comment>
        <p>This level is intended to allow broader use of the resource than standard access allows.
        For example, the resource could be copied and distributed free of charge, for academic
        purposes, or it could be used to create derivative works, such as transcriptions, for 
        non-profit purposes.</p>
      </comment>
    </term>
    <term>
      <code>commercial</code>
      <name>Commercial</name>
      <definition>The resource can be used for commercial purposes.</definition>
      <comment>
        <p>The resource can be freely used for any purpose without explicit permission from the
        creators or data providers, including copying and distribution for profit, incorporation
        into commercial products, and the creation of derivative works.</p>

  <todo>
    <p>Identify a good expression of standard access that we can cite or link to. What we really
    need is a repository of such expressions from different countries and sub-disciplines.</p>
    <p>Provide a standard for citing resources in an accessible place.</p>
