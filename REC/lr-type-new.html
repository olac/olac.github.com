         <h2><A name="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction
         </h2>
         <p>The Language Resource Type vocabulary, like its predecessor, the Linguistic Data Type vocabulary, is an extension of the Dublin
            Core Type element. Experience gained in applying the OLAC Linguistic Data Type extension during the 1.x stage of OLAC development
            showed that this conception of linguistic data type was too restrictive for many kinds of resources that need a similar kind
            of broad categorization, but are targeting a somwhat wider user group that includes, but is not limited to, linguistic researchers.
            Workers in the areas of language development, and language and culture revitalization, especially among endangered languages,
            have need of easy identification of resources of interest in and about such languages, that goes beyond the three basic linguistic
            data types, into areas of language and other educational instruction, cultural description, and development planning. 
         </p>
         <p>Though the Language Resource Type vocabulary contains a wider array of terms than was included in Linguistic Data Type, it
            is still expected that it will not apply to many items described using the OLAC metadata format. Language Resource Type should
            be omitted if none of the following vocabulary terms applies. However, the element may be repeated if a resource represents
            more than one language resource type. So, for example, a primary text accompanied by a lexicon of vocabulary items would be
            described as both a primary text and a lexicon. A dictionary designed for language learners can be described as both lexicon
            and language instruction.
         </p>
         <p>
            In some cases, adequate description of a linguistic resource, particularly those of type Primary_text, will benefit from using
            both the Language Resource Type extension and the Discourse Type extension of the Type element. For example, a narrative text
            might be described as both a primary text (OLAC Linguistic Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type). The Linguistic Field
            vocabulary (extension for the Subject element) is also helpful for adding greater specificity. For example, a phonological
            description resource would be described using Language_description in the Type element (using OLAC Language Resource Type
            extension) and Phonology in the Subject element (using OLAC Linguistic Field extension).
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Note that a kind of resource being in a particular form, such as a machine readable structured dataset, is not specified by
            the Language Resource Type extension, but  should be specified using a separate instance of the Type element, applying the
            DCMI Type vocabulary, e.g. Dataset.  See: [<a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/dcmitype/">DC-TYPE</a>].
            
         </p>
         <h2><A name="Language Resource Type"></A>2. Language Resource Type
         </h2>
         <p>Each term in the controlled vocabulary is described in the following subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for
            the term that is to be used as the value of the code attribute of the "OLAC-LanguageResource-Type" extension of the Type metadata
            element [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/olacms.html">OLAC-MS</a>]. Under the heading, the term is described in four ways. <i>Name</i> gives a descriptive label for the term. <i>Definition</i> is a one-line summary of what the term means. <i>Comments</i> offers more details on what the term represents. Examples may also be given to illustrate how the term is meant to be applied.
