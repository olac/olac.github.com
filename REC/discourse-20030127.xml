<p>
The Discourse Type extension of the Type element is used to describe the
content of a resource as representing discourse of a particular structural
type. It will typically be used when the resource is itself an object of
study, as, for example, when the resource is a primary text. So it will
usually occur in conjunction with the Linguistic Data Type extension.   For
example, a narrative text would  be described as both a primary text (OLAC
Linguistic Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type).

<p>
Each term in the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the following
subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is to be
used as the value of the code attribute of the "OLAC-Discourse-Type"
extension of the Type metadata element <cit>OLAC-MS</cit>. Under the heading, the
term is described in four ways. Name gives a descriptive label for the term.
Definition is a one-line summary of what the term means. Comments offers
more details on what the term represents. Examples may also be given to
illustrate how the term is meant to be applied.
