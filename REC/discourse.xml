         <p> This document specifies the codes, or controlled vocabulary, for the Discourse Type
            extension of the Type metadata element. These codes describe the content of a resource
            as structured in such a way as to represent a particular type of discourse. </p>

         <p>The previous version of this document wss adopted, but the published XML schema was
            never updated to match it and none of the
            participating archives has ever followed any of the
            changes to the vocabulary. The XML
            schema and all existing implementations by participating archives
             are consistent with the 2002-11-21 version of this Recommendation, but
            are inconsistent with later versions. Therefore, to serve as a basis for further
            development by the implementing archives, this document has been reverted to the
            2002-11-21 version of the vocabulary terms while bringing forward compatible 
            changes to the definitions. </p>

         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p> The Discourse Type extension of the Type element is used to describe the content of a
            resource as representing discourse of a particular structural type. It will typically be
            used when the resource is itself an object of study, as, for example, when the resource
            is a primary text. So it will usually occur in conjunction with the Linguistic Data Type
            extension. For example, a narrative text would be described as both a primary text (OLAC
            Linguistic Type) and a narrative (OLAC Discourse Type). </p>

         <heading>Discourse Type</heading>

         <p> Each term in the controlled vocabulary is described in one of the following
            subsections. The heading gives the encoded value for the term that is to be used as the
            value of the <tt>olac:code</tt> attribute of the <tt>xsi:type="olac:discourse-type"</tt>
            extension of the Type metadata element <cit>OLAC-Usage</cit>. Under the heading, the
            term is described in four ways. <i>Name</i> gives a descriptive label for the term.
               <i>Definition</i> is a one-line summary of what the term means. <i>Comments</i>
            offers more details on what the term represents. <i>Examples</i> may also be given to
            illustrate how the term is meant to be applied. </p>
