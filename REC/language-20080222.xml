         <heading>Introduction</heading>
         <p>Identifying the specific languages involved is an important dimension of language
            resource description. However, using the character-string representation of language
            names as identifiers is problematic for several reasons: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>Different languages (in different parts of the world) may have the same name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>The same language may have different names in different languages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>The same language may have different names in the various countries where it is
                  spoken.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Within the same country, the preferred name for a language may change over
               time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>In the early history of discovering languages (before their names were
                  standardized), different people referred to the same language by different
               names.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>For languages having non-Roman orthographies, the language name may have several
                  possible romanizations.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>These facts taken together mean that identifying languages by name will not work.
            Rather, what is needed is a standard based on unique identifiers that do not change,
            combined with accessible documentation that clarifies the particular speech variety
            denoted by each identifier. For a deeper discussion of these issues see
            <cit>CS2000</cit> and <cit>Simons2000</cit>.</p>
         <p>The information technology community has a well-established standard for language
            identification, namely, ISO 639. Part 1 of the standard specifies two-letter codes for
            identifying about 180 of the world's major languages; part 2 specifies three-letter
            codes for identifying approximately 400 languages <cit>ISO639-2</cit>. These code sets
            in turn form the core of the standard followed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
            (IETF), namely, RFC 3066 <cit>RFC3066</cit>. This is the standard used for language
            identification in the <tt>xml:lang</tt> attribute of XML <cit>XML-lang</cit>. The Dublin
            Core Metadata Initiative <cit>DCMT</cit> defines encoding schemes
            <i>dcterms:ISO639-2</i> and <i>dcterms:RFC3066</i> for use in its Language element.</p>
         <p>The above standards fall short of the coverage required by the language archiving
            community since they focus on the major languages of the world that are most frequently
            represented in the total body of the world's literature. A new part 3 of the standard
               <cit>ISO639-3</cit>, adopted in 2007, has the purpose of defining three-letter
            identifiers for all known human languages. With over 7,500 codes, it attempts to provide
            a comprehensive enumeration of languages, including living, extinct, ancient, and
            constructed languages, whether major or minor. This is the standard that forms the basis
            for the OLAC recommendation on language identification in language resource description.
            The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative <cit>DCMT</cit> also recognizes
            <i>dcterms:ISO639-3</i> as an encoding scheme for use in its Language element.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <heading>The olac:language extension</heading>
         <p>The complete vocabulary of language identifiers recommended for use by OLAC consists of
            all active codes for individual languages from any part of ISO 639. In the case of codes
            from Part 1 or Part 2, the OLAC harvester will normalize these to the equivalent Part 3
            code before storing the record. The equivalencies are shown in the code tables at the
            web site of the <cit>ISO639-3</cit> Registration Authority. Every two-letter code from
            Part 1 has a three-letter equivalent in Part 3. Part 2 codes for individual languages
            are identical to Part 3 codes except in the case of around 20 languages for which Part 2
            has both a "bibliographic" code and a "terminological" code. Part 3 matches the
            terminological set; thus any bibliographic code is normalized to its terminological
            equivalent. The OLAC harvester also normalizes language codes supplied in upper case to
            their lower case equivalents.</p>
         <p>Following the extension mechanism defined in <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>, a language
            identifier is expressed as the value of the <tt>olac:code</tt> attribute and the
            extension <tt>olac:language</tt> is named in the <tt>xsi:type</tt> attribute. A language
            identifier may be used with the <tt>&lt;dc:language&gt;</tt> element to identify
            a language that a resource is written or spoken in. Thus the following six elements are
            recognized as equivalent ways of specifying a document written in the German language:</p>
         <eg>&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="de"/&gt;
&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="deu"/&gt;
&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="ger"/&gt;
&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="DE"/&gt;
&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="DEU"/&gt;
&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="GER"/&gt;</eg>
         <p>All of the above are normalized by the OLAC harvester to the equivalent lower-case Part
            3 identifier:</p>
         <eg>&lt;dc:language xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="deu"/&gt;</eg>
         <p>Similarly, a language identifier may be used with the
            <tt>&lt;dc:subject&gt;</tt> element to identify a language that a resource is
            about. In both the Language element and the Subject element, free text in the element
            content may be used to identify the specific variety of the language. For instance, the
            following indicates that a resource is about the Lau language of Solomon Islands and,
            specifically, the Suafa dialect:</p>
         <eg>&lt;dc:subject xsi:type="olac:language" olac:code="llu"&gt;Suafa dialect&lt;/dc:subject&gt;</eg>
         <p>The formal definition of the vocabulary is in the following XML schema which conforms to
            the conventions for an OLAC metadata extension as defined in <cit>OLAC-Metadata</cit>:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               <url>http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/olac-language.xsd</url>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>The schema requires only that the code value be a string of two or three letters, either
            upper case or lower case. Validity of the actual identifiers used in metadata is not
            tested as a precondition for harvesting, but is tested periodically by a service on the
            OLAC site. The latter approach is needed because individual identifiers may be retired
            from active use by the ISO 639-3 Registration Authority; the validation service thus
            alerts participating archives to identifiers in their metadata records that are no
            longer active and relays the instructions given by the ISO 639-3/RA as to the appropriate
            remedy. In addition to flagging retired identifiers, the validation service also flags
            identifiers that are undefined or for local use as errors, and those that are collective
            or for macrolanguages as less than best practice. See <cit>ISO639-Scope</cit> for the
            definition of <i>local use, collective,</i> and <i>macrolanguage</i>. </p>

         <heading>Looking up the language for a code</heading>
         <p>Given a particular three-letter code, the ISO 639-3 web site provides a means of looking
            up documentation for what the code represents. The three letters are appended to the
            documentation page URL as the value of the <i>id</i> parameter, as in:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               <url>http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=abc</url>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>In addition to the basic information available on this page, more detailed information
            is available through a link to the corresponding page on the Ethnologue web site
               <cit>Ethnologue</cit> for a living or recently extinct language, or on the Linguist
            List website for an ancient <cit>LL-Ancient</cit> or constructed
            <cit>LL-Constructed</cit> language.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
         <heading>Looking up the code for a language</heading>
         <p>The easiest way to find the code for a living or recently extinct language is to type
            the name of a language or dialect or region into the Ethnologue's site search form at:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               <url>http://www.ethnologue.com/site_search.asp</url>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>When you know the country the language is spoken in, another approach is to use the
            country index to find a listing of all the languages in that particular country and then
            to browse the list:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               <url>http://www.ethnologue.com/country_index.asp</url>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Linguist List offers a language search page based on name and country information
            downloaded from <cit>Ethnologue-Codes</cit> plus similar information they have compiled
            regarding ancient and constructed languages:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               <url>http://www.linguistlist.org/forms/langs/find-a-language-or-family.html</url>
            </p>
         </blockquote>

         <p>See <cit>ISO639-3-Changes</cit> for a description of the process by which changes are
            made to the international standard. Follow this process if you believe that something is
            missing or in error. Note that the standard reserves codes <tt>qaa</tt> through
            <tt>qtz</tt> for local use. That is, those codes will never be assigned as language
            identifiers. Thus, when users feel that a needed code is missing from the code set, they
            may use a local use code in their own database as a temporary measure until the outcome
            of a change request is known. Note, however, that local use codes are undefined for
            information interchange and should not be submitted to the OLAC harvester.</p>
         <p>The standard is updated in major annual updates, and minor updates as needed. It takes
            time for these changes to propagate, so that
            Ethnologue and Linguist List are not always up to date.  Note that <cit>ISO639-3</cit> is
            <i>the</i> authority in cases where the reference sites differ, which is typically due to
            their differing update schedules.</p>
