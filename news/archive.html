<h2><a name="2k"></a>OLAC Search Engine Handles 2000 Queries Per Day: [4/06]</h2>

<p>
In 2005, the OLAC Search Engine handled 824,676 queries, an average of
2259 per day or an average 68273 per month.  The most popular
languages searched for in 2005 were Dutch, English, Quechua, Arabic,
Greek, German, Chinese, and Malay.  Only 35% of queries specified a
particular archive, the majority were generic searches across all
archives. The most commonly searched repository was SIL-LCA, followed
by PARADISEC and SCOIL.

<h2><a name="emeld06"></a>EMELD Workshop on Digital Language Documentation: [3/06]</h2>

<p>
The 2006 E-MELD workshop will focus on 'Tools and Standards: the State of the Art.'
This annual workshop marks the culmination of the 5-year E-MELD project;
one goal of the workshop is to review digital standards ratified by the
community in prior workshops on text, lexicons, databases, and annotation.
The workshop will be held in July, in conjunction with the LSA Summer Meeting at
Michigan State University.

<h2><a name="lsa"></a>OLAC at the LSA: [10/04]</h2>

<p>
OLAC will be organizing a booth in the publisher's exhibit hall at the
Linguistic Society of America meeting in San Francisco in January.
OLAC search services will be demonstrated, and OLAC archives are
invited to send someone to help staff the booth, to give live
demonstrations of their web interfaces and to hand out flyers for
their projects.  The booth and web access are expensive and we welcome
any offers of sponsorship.  If you would like to be involved, please

<h2><a name="ldc"></a>LDC Hosts OLAC Search Interface: [7/04]</h2>

<p>
The Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania now
hosts a powerful OLAC search interface.  Features include result
summaries by archive, result ranking, approximate language name
matching, and country-based searches.  (The service was developed by
Amol Kamat, Baden Hughes, and Steven Bird at the University of
Melbourne, with sponsorship from the Department of Computer Science
and Software Engineering and the Linguistic Data Consortium.)

<h2><a name="report"></a>Archive Report Cards: [7/04]</h2>

<p>
The archive report cards, added to the OLAC site in March, give
summary statistics for each repository and an assessment of the
quality of the repository's metadata.  The assessment is based on OLAC
and Dublin Core guidelines.  An updated version of the system is now
available, including a revised evaluation algorithm to account for
changes in DC recommendations, and revised labelling of the reports
for consistency with OLAC terminology.  The evaluation metric rewards
the use of OLAC extensions (controlled vocabularies), and what we
consider to be the most important DC elements: title, date, subject,
description, and identifier.  The report cards can be accessed by
clicking the "REPORT CARD" links on the OLAC Archives page.

<h2><a name="metadata"></a>OLAC Metadata standard adopted: [3/04]</h2>

<p>
The OLAC Metadata standard has been promoted to `adopted' status
by the OLAC Council following a 12 month period of experimentation by
OLAC implementers.  This document defines the format used for the
interchange of metadata within the framework of the Open Archives
Initiative. The metadata set is based on Qualified Dublin Core, but
the format allows for the use of extensions to express
community-specific qualifiers.

<h2><a name="rosetta"></a>OLAC Archive on board European Space Agency
mission [3/04]</h2>

On March 2, the Rosetta Disk left Earth on board an Ariane-5 rocket
from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guyana.  The mission's
target is the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which will be reached in
2014 after a "billiard ball" journey through the Solar System lasting
more than ten years.  The Rosetta Disk is a modern version of the
Rosetta Stone. The 2-inch nickel disk is micro-etched with 30,000
pages of information covering over 1,000 languages.  For each language
there is a simple dictionary, a guide to pronunciation and counting,
and a traditional story with translation.  Additionally, to help
language decipherment in remote futures, a translation of a common
text (the first three chapters of the book of Genesis) is provided in
all languages.  The disk can be read with the aid of an optical
microscope.  The materials on the disk come from the Rosetta 1000
Language Archive, an OLAC repository.

<h2><a name="dlf-report"></a>
OLAC identified as "exemplary" in DLF report: [1/04]</h2>

<p>
In a recent <i>Survey of Digital Library Aggregation Services</i>,
published by the Digital Library Federation,
Martha Brogan praised the Open Language Archives Community as
exemplary. She concluded her discussion with the following statement:

<blockquote>
OLAC is exemplary in several ways: the technical and social
infrastructure that it has developed to support its community of
contributors, based on shared principles and standards; the resources
that it provides at its Web site about its purpose, scope, history,
tools, news and events; and the efforts of its two leaders -- Gary Simons
and Steven Bird [2003a, 2003b, 2003c] -- to articulate the challenges,
analyze the options, and recommend possible solutions to their
community of contributors in order to improve OLAC. With the formal
appointment of an Outreach Working Group and its other efforts to
accommodate small archives that lack technical support, OLAC's content
and influence is likely to grow.

<h2><a name="repositories"></a>OLAC Repositories standard adopted: [9/03]</h2>

<p> The OLAC Repositories standard has been promoted to `adopted'
status by the OLAC Council following a 9 month period of
experimentation by OLAC implementers.  This document defines the
standards OLAC archives must follow in implementing a metadata
repository.  Originally called the OLAC Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting, this document was first drafted in December 2001.  A year
later it was broadened to cover the new static repository model and
given a more general title.  Since then there have been two further
revisions in response to consultation with the community.  After a
further round of revision in consultation with the OLAC Council, the
document is now adopted as the second OLAC standard.

<p>
The OLAC Process document has been promoted to `adopted' status by the
OLAC Advisory Board.  The process document summarizes the governing
ideas of OLAC and describes how OLAC is organized and how it operates,
including the document process and working group process.
First drafted in May 2001, the document has been revised in
consultation with the community over the past two years, as it has
progressed through `draft', `proposed', and `candidate' status.
After one more round of revision in consultation with the Advisory
Board, the document is now adopted as the first OLAC standard.

<h2><a name="wired"></a>OLAC in Wired News [11/02]</h2>

<p>
On November 4, 2002, Wired News published an article called
<i>Word Up: Keeping Languages Alive</i> which discusses OLAC
in connection with the Rosetta Project, one of our member archives.
In the article, Gary Simons is quoted as saying:
"The computing and recording technologies that are now standard tools in
doing field linguistics are changing so quickly that information captured
electronically today could cease to be accessible in another decade or two
if special care is not taken to ensure that it is archived in stable
formats by stable institutions."  (Developing recommendations in this
area will be a key focus of OLAC in 2003 - Steven Bird)

<h2><a name="service"></a>OLAC Search Engine [12/01]</h2>

<p>
OLAC has developed an experimental cross-archive search engine.
It now harvests 18,000 records from 13 OLAC archives: LDC, ELRA, DFKI, TDProject,
Perseus, ANLC, APS, LACITO, CBOLD, AISRI, TRACTOR, OTA and Ethnologue.
The search engine may be accessed via the
banner on this page.  Users may query it by entering
language names and/or linguistic resource types.  A fielded search
function is also available.

<p>
Because OLAC archives are also members of the
Open Archives Initiative, queries on OAI service providers return hits
from OLAC archives.  Users can test this out by visiting the ARC
cross-archive searching service and entering the query term "lexicon".
OLAC is developing a new cross-archive searching service based on ARC.

<p>
Another feature that OLAC archives inherit from the OAI is a gateway
for web crawlers, permitting OLAC records to be discovered using
conventional search engines.
