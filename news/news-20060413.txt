News from the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)

Dear Community,

Here is a summary of the developments in the Open Language Archives
Community over the last year.  Full details are available at:

OLAC SEARCH ENGINE HANDLES 2000 QUERIES PER DAY

In 2005, the OLAC Search Engine handled 824,676 queries, an average of
2259 per day or an average 68273 per month.  The most popular
languages searched for in 2005 were Dutch, English, Quechua, Arabic,
Greek, German, Chinese, and Malay.  Only 35% of queries specified a
particular archive, the majority were generic searches across all
archives. The most commonly searched repository was SIL-LCA, followed
by PARADISEC and SCOIL.  Thanks to Baden Hughes for his analysis of
the server logs.

EMELD WORKSHOP ON DIGITAL LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION

The 2006 E-MELD workshop will focus on 'Tools and Standards: the State
of the Art.'  This annual workshop marks the culmination of the 5-year
E-MELD project; one goal of the workshop is to review digital
standards ratified by the community in prior workshops on text,
lexicons, databases, and annotation.  The workshop will be held in
June, in conjunction with the LSA Summer Meeting at Michigan State
University.

EMELD WORKSHOP ON DIGITAL LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION

LSA TUTORIAL ON ARCHIVING AND LINGUISTIC RESOURCES

This tutorial provided a forum where people who are compiling documentary
linguistic resources could learn about current best practices for
creating and conserving those resources.  The tutorial was organized
by Jeff Good (MPI Leipzig) and Heidi Johnson (University of Texas,
Austin and AILLA) and held at the annual meeting of the Linguistic
Society of America, in Oakland, California, in January 2005.
