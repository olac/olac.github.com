<h1>
White Paper on Establishing an Infrastructure for Open Language Archiving</h1>

<h2>
Steven Bird and Gary Simons<br>
Draft: 7 December 2000
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
<i><b>About this document.</b><br>
This document was prepared in conjunction with the
workshop on
<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/expl2000/">
Web-Based Language Documentation and Description</a>,
held in Philadelphia on 12-15 December 2000, and subsequently
revised with input from workshop participants.  At the
end of the workshop, the participants agreed to form
the <i>Open Language Archives Community</i> proposed in this document.
</i>

<hr><br>

<p>
This white paper is the culmination of a series of four documents.
The <a href="vision.html">vision statement</a>
analyzes the gap between what users need and the ideal situation
we are aiming for.
The <a href="requirements.html">requirements document</a>
describes the ideal situation in considerable detail, while the
<a href="survey.html">survey</a> gives an overview of the
situation we find outselves in today.

<p>
This document is a proposal for an Open Language Archives Community,
laying out the technical components and showing how they support the
"Seven Pillars of Open Language Archiving" described in the
<a href="vision.html">vision statement</a>.  We begin by describing the
<i>Open Archives Initiative</i>, and then show how it provides a suitable
technical infrastructure for the community we wish to create.

<a name="1."><h2>1. The Open Archives Initiative</h2></a>

<p>
The Open Archives initiative (OAI)
was launched in October 1999 to provide a common framework across
electronic preprint archives
[<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org/</a>].
The first and largest such archive is the
Los Alamos National Laboratory Physics Archive, founded
in 1991, which houses over 100,000 papers and serves 50,000 users daily
[<a href="http://arXiv.org/">http://arXiv.org/</a>].
As other disciplines and institutions have begun to create their own
public research archives, it has become apparent that conventions are
needed so that archives can cooperate, and so that
any holding in any of these archives can be found from anyone's desktop
worldwide, as if everything was held in a single virtual public library.

<p>
At its last meeting in September 2000, the OAI vision was broadened
to include digital repositories of scholarly materials regardless
of their type.
As stated, their new mission is:
"to supply and promote an application independent technical framework - a
supportive infrastructure that empowers different scholarly communities to
pursue their own interests in interoperability in the technical, legal,
business, and organizational contexts that are appropriate to them"
[<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/oai-tech-cornell/cornell_report.pdf">http://www.openarchives.org/oai-tech-cornell/cornell_report.pdf</a>].
The rest of this section prsents the key concepts which comprise
the OAI framework.

<p>
In the OAI infrastructure, each participating archive implements a
repository, a network accessible server offering public access
to archive holdings. The primary object in an OAI-conformant
repository is called an <i>item</i>, having a unique identifier
and being associated with one or more metadata records.
Each metadata record describes an archive holding, which is any
kind of primary resource such as a document, data, software, a
recording, a physical artifact, a digital surrogate, and so forth.
Each metadata record will usually contain a reference to an entry
point for the holding, such as a URL or a physical location,
as shown in Figure 1.
(Note that in OAI parlance, both the metadata repository and the primary
archive are often referred to as archives.)

<p>
<table cellspacing="8" align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="white-paper1.gif" alt="{Figure 1}" border="1">
</td></tr><tr><td>
Figure 1: The Relationship Between an OAI Repository and an Archive
</td></tr></table>

<p>
To implement the OAI infrastructure, a participating archive must comply
with two standards: the OAI shared metadata set, and the OAI metadata
harvesting protocol.

<p>
The OAI specifies the Dublin Core as the shared metadata set.
Every item in an OAI-conformant repository must be able to describe itself
in terms of the Dublin Core. The purpose of this requirement is to
facilitate interoperability across all communities participating in the
OAI. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in 1995 to develop
conventions for resource discovery on the web
[<a href="http://purl.org/DC/">http://purl.org/DC/</a>].
The Dublin Core metadata elements represent a broad, interdisciplinary
consensus about
the core set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support
resource discovery.  The Dublin Core consists of 15 metadata elements,
where each element is optional and repeatable: Title, Creator, Subject,
Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source,
Language, Relation, Coverage, Rights.
This metadata set can be used to describe resources that
exist in digital or traditional formats.

<p>
The OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol allows
software services to query a repository using HTTP requests. The protocol
supports the following six service requests:

<ul>
<li> <b>Identify</b>:
returns a self-description of the archive, containing administrative
information;
<li> <b>ListIdentifiers</b>:
returns a list of identifiers of metadata records that are offered by
the archive;
<li> <b>ListMetadataFormats</b>:
returns a list of identifiers of metadata formats that are offered by the
archive, either in general or for a particular record;
<li> <b>ListSets</b>:
returns a structured list of sets within which records may be located;
<li> <b>ListRecords</b>:
returns a list of record identifiers, and optionally metadata, within a
specified range of dates and/or a specified set. Flow control is achieved by
the use of server-generated continuation tokens;
<li> <b>GetRecord</b>:
returns the metadata associated with an identifier.
</ul>

<p>
OAI archives are called "data providers," though they are strictly just
<i>metadata</i> providers. Typically, data providers will also have a
submission procedure, together with a long-term storage system, and a
mechanism permitting users to obtain materials from the archive. An OAI
"service provider" is a third party that provides end-user services (such
as search functions over union catalogs) based on metadata harvested from one or
more OAI data providers. A service provider uses the metadata harvesting
protocol to collect metadata from participating archives and build a
database which forms the basis of their service. Figure 2 illustrates a
single service provider accessing three data providers. End-users only
interact with service providers.

<p>
<table cellspacing="8" align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="white-paper2.gif" alt="{Figure 2}" border="1">
</td></tr><tr><td>
Figure 2: A Service Provider Accessing Multiple Data Providers
</td></tr></table>

<p>
The item identifiers of a data provider are unique for that provider.
To avoid collisions and to permit identifiers to be resolved across
the whole OAI community, each data provider is assigned a
unique identifier.
The syntax for fully qualified identifiers is:
<i>oai : &lt;archive-identifier&gt; : &lt;record-identifier&gt;</i>.

<h2>2. Forming an Open Language Archives Community within the OAI
Framework</h2>

<p>
The OAI Community is defined by the archives which 
comply with the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol
and that register with the OAI.
Any compliant repository can register as an Open Archive.
The metadata provided by an Open Archive is open to the public.
A consequence of this definition of community is that
there is no special notion of
"OAI membership" other than participation in the infrastructure,
either as a data provider, a service provider, or a user.
A diagram of the OAI community is shown in Figure 3.

<p>
<table cellspacing="8" align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="white-paper3.gif" alt="{Figure 3}" border="1">
</td></tr><tr><td>
Figure 3: The Open Archives Community
</td></tr></table>

<p>
OAI data providers may support metadata standards in addition
to Dublin Core, and the <tt>ListMetadataFormats</tt> request will
report all metadata formats supported by a repository.
A specialist community can define a metadata format which is
specific to its domain.  Service providers, data providers and users that
employ this specialized metadata format constitute an OAI <i>subcommunity</i>.
For OAI compliance, the subcommunity's data providers must support
Dublin Core (in addition to any other metadata formats).
The syntax or semantics of these other formats is outside the scope
of the OAI.

<p>
Our <a href="vision.html">vision statement</a>
describes a user community that creates and uses
language documentation which is cut off from the DATA, TOOLS
and ADVICE that it needs in order to function effectively.
It goes on to propose the
formation of a more formal Open Language Archives Community
(OLAC) to address the situation.
Community-agreed specialized METADATA, supported by
data providers and service providers that are accessible from
a single GATEWAY, will bridge the gap.  The harvesting protocol is
the central STANDARD which brings all these pieces together.
Thus, the OAI provides a large piece of the infrastructure needed
for our community.

<p>
The first port of call for end users will be the OLAC GATEWAY.
This will provide a centralized registry of OLAC data providers
and service providers.
(Technical details about the functioning of this registry are
given in a recent proposal to the OAI
[<a href="community-providers.html">community-providers.html</a>].)
Open Language Archives will register with the OLAC Gateway,
and it will validate their metadata for conformance with the
OLAC metadata schema as a service to the community.

<p>
Figure 4 shows the envisioned Open Language Archives Community.
Users will navigate via the gateway to the service provider of their
choice, and then search a catalog of archive holdings.

<p>
<table cellspacing="8" align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="white-paper4.gif" alt="{Figure 4}" border="1">
</td></tr><tr><td>
Figure 4: The Envisioned Open Language Archives Community
</td></tr></table>

<p>
The double headed arrow on the right represents the fact that each data
provider must register with the gateway (the upwards direction) and that the
gateway will validate the metadata served by each data provider (the downwards
direction).  From the service provider level there is an arrow going up
to the gateway, since service providers will need to query the OLAC registry to
find out what data providers exist.  The arrow going down from service
providers to data providers corresponds to the metadata harvesting protocol.
Service providers will collect and index the metadata records provided by
each data provider.

<p>
In time, the number of data providers and service providers would
grow.  Some would be quite general in coverage, while others would
be restricted or specialized in some way.  For example, a particular
data provider might only house materials for Bantu languages.
A particular service provider may build extended indexing and
processing services just for lexical data and tools.
In this manner, the Open Language Archive Community will provide
interoperability without limiting diversity.

<h2>3. A Metadata Set for the Open Language Archives Community</h2>

<P>
The thing that makes the Open Language Archives Community a distinct
subcommunity within the set of all archives participating in the Open Archives
Initiative is its metadata set. It is by means of this metadata set that our
community expresses the information about archive holdings that are fundamental
to the enterprise of language documentation. This section of the white paper
defines what those fundamental information elements are. But before doing that,
we first discuss basic design decisions that constrain the form that the OLAC
metadata set ultimately takes.</P>

<H3>3.1. Design decisions</H3>
<P>In developing the OLAC metadata set we have been guided by the following
three design decisions:</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>We need a low overhead metadata set.</P>
<P>By low overhead we mean that the complexity and size of the metadata scheme
is kept to a minimum. We need this for two reasons. First, the cost of encoding
the metadata for an archive wanting to join the community must not be so high
as to pose an obstacle. Second, the range of kinds of holdings in language
archives is vast, including materials like hand-written field notes,
descriptive articles and monographs, sound and video recordings, and annotated
corpora. The OLAC metadata set may not privilege any one of these holding
types, but must be the common denominator that is relevant to all types.</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>We should build on the Dublin Core metadata set.</P>
<P>The Dublin Core metadata set already caters to the common needs of a broad
spectrum of holding types. It is also a standard that every OLAC archive will
already need to support since it is the metadata set of the OAI. Thus it is
expedient to build our OLAC metadata set on top of it. That is, every element
of the Dublin Core metadata set is also an element of the OLAC metadata set so
that all the work a participating archive does to describe its holdings in
terms of Dublin Core will transfer to the OLAC metadata set without change.</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>We should build on Dublin Core by using the qualification mechanism
recognized by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.</P>
<P>For the specialized metadata of our community, how should we extend the base
Dublin Core metadata set? The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative already has an
answer for this. In &quot;Dublin Core Qualifiers&quot; [<A
HREF="http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm">http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm</A>],
the DCMI recommends principles governing the qualification of base elements to
make them more specific. In defining the metadata elements unique to OLAC, we
will follow these guidelines for qualifying existing DC elements rather than
developing altogether new elements.</P>
</LI>
</OL>

<H3>3.2. OLAC metadata elements for data</H3>
<P>Given that the OLAC metadata set should extend the Dublin Core set only to
the minimum degree needed to express what is fundamental about open language
archiving, we are now confronted with determining what that minimal set of
extensions is. The
<a href="requirements.html">requirements document</a>
provides the answer. It turns out that the metadata elements we must add are
exactly those needed to meet the requirements of the user community.
User requirements
4 through 8 describe specific needs that can only be met through
special-purpose metadata elements. These involve:</P>
<OL START="4">
<LI>identifying the languages that archived items relate to,</LI>
<LI>identifying how open versus how restricted an item is,</LI>
<LI>identifying format and encoding details for digital resources, </LI>
<LI>identifying other resources required for using an item, and</LI>
<LI>matching data resources with appropriate software tools.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In &quot;Dublin Core Qualifiers&quot; [<A
HREF="http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm">http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm</A>],
two kinds of qualifications are allowed: encoding schemes and refinements. An
<I>encoding scheme</I> specifies a particular controlled vocabulary or notation
for expressing the value of an element. The encoding scheme serves to aid a
client system in interpreting the exact meaning of the element content. A
<I>refinement</I> makes the meaning of the element narrower (or more specific).
A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified, but with a more
restricted scope. </P>
<P>Two OLAC metadata requirements can be met just by qualifying two existing
elements with an encoding scheme. The <I>Language</I> element can be encoded
using the conventions of RFC 1766 to unambiguously identify the language is
written (or spoken). To handle the full range of the world's languages, SIL
language codes are used as described in
&quot;<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/expl2000/papers/simons/simons.htm">Language Identification in 
Metadata Descriptions of Language Archive Holdings</a>&quot; (Simons 2000). The
<I>Format</I> element can be encoded using the Internet Media Type (also known
as MIME type) as a means of unambiguously identifying the format of a digital
resource. Thus,</P>

<P>The remaining OLAC metadata requirements are met by refining existing Dublin
Core elements. These include identifying the language being documented or
described, summarizing the openness of an item both in terms of its rights of
use and its format, specifying more detail about the character encoding and
markup of digital text resources, identifying the broad category of data made
available in the item, and identifying other resources that are needed to use
the item.</P>

<P>This treatment of the OLAC metadata set has merely presented an overview.

later document, &quot;OLAC Metadata Set: Reference Description&quot;. </P>

<H3>3.3. Additional OLAC metadata for tools and advice</H3>

<p>
Having obtained material from an OLAC archive, an end-user may
want to find software which understands the format, or a tool
to convert data from the format into a more convenient format.
There already exist many
software tools, data models and formats, fonts, and best practice
recommendations, and the quantity of these resources continues to
grow rapidly.  As with the primary language materials, we need
finding aids for the computational resources.
To meet this need, we extend the OLAC metadata set to cover
computational resources.

<p>
In three cases, we simply reuse the same metadata elements required for OLAC
data, but broaden the interpretation to include tools.  These elements are
repeated below with revised definitions.

<p>
<TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1" ALIGN="CENTER" CELLPADDING="12">

<TD>requires</TD>
<TD>Gives the URI of another resource that is needed to be able to use the

</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>
In addition to these, there are six new refinements to the
Dublin Core elements, listed below.

</TD>
</TR>
<TR>

<TD>Identifies the broad functionality of the software, as one of:

<TD>os</TD>
<TD>Identifies the operating system(s) for which the software is available,

(in the case of binary distributions), using the following
inventory: x86, mips, alpha, ppc, sparc, 680x0
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>
So far we have considered data and tools.  Material from the third category,
advice, will pertain to data, or tools, or both.  Therefore it will employ
some mixture of the data and tools metadata.

<P>This treatment of the OLAC metadata set has merely presented an overview.
The detailed definition of the metadata set will be provided in a
later document, &quot;OLAC Metadata Set: Reference Description&quot;. </P>

<H3>3.4. Other metadata refinements</H3>
<P>Another of the user requirements speaks to metadata and the need for it to
be uniform so as to support focussed searching:</P>
<OL START="3">
<LI><P>Uniform metadata descriptions can be used to perform focussed searching
of language resources by metadata categories regardless of where on the Web
they may actually be archived.</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>The metadata refinements listed above, all of which were motivated by more
specific requirements, also serve to address this requirement. But there are
potentially other refinements that would be justified solely on the basis of
supporting the kinds of searches that the OLAC user community will want to
make.</P>
<P>In general, the value of an unqualified Dublin Core metadata element can be
interpreted by humans and thus may profitably be used in keyword searches.
However, to take advantage of metadata for more focussed searching, it may be
necessary to refine elements that are too broad or to provide encoding schemes
that enable a computer to interpret the values. In envisioning the kind of
search facility we want for the combined catalog of all OLAC holdings, the
community must decide which metadata elements it would like to further qualify.
For instance, these are possible qualifications:</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1" ALIGN="CENTER" CELLPADDING="12">
<TR>
<TH>Dublin Core element</TH>
<TH>Possible qualification</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Date</TD>
<TD>We could specify a particular encoding scheme that would always be used
with Date in OLAC metadata.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Identifier</TD>
<TD>We could specify that Identifier is always encoded as a URI.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Relation</TD>
<TD>We could support additional refinements of Relation like <I>isPartOf</I>
and <I>hasPart</I> to encode the relationship between a corpus and component
resources within it, or <I>isReplacedBy</I> and <I>replaces</I> to encode the
succession of versions.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Subject</TD>
<TD>In addition to <I>language</I>, we could add refinements like
<I>country</I>, <I>topic</I>, and <I>classification</I> (e.g. language family
or subgroup) and maintain separate controlled vocabularies for these.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Format</TD>
<TD>We could provide encoding schemes for operating systems, CPUs, and
software licence categories, using existing inventories where possible
(e.g. the Open Software Description Format
provides a (dated) inventory of operating systems and CPUs
[<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-OSD.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-OSD.html</a>]).
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>3.5. Controlled vocabulary servers</H3>
<P>Many of the metadata elements use controlled vocabularies. Elements like
<I>Format.openness</I> and <I>Rights.openness</I> use such small vocabularies
that all the possible values are enumerated in an XML DTD for the metadata set
so that the values can be validated when the metadata record is validated.</P>
<P>For other metadata elements that use a controlled vocabulary, the list of
possible values may be very large (as with <I>Subject.language</I>) or it
involves an open-ended list (as with <I>Format.markup</I>). In such cases,
enumerating the possible values in the DTD will not work. To handle controlled
vocabularies of this kind, the design of the Open Language Archives Community
includes &quot;controlled vocabulary servers.&quot;</P>
<P>A <I>controlled vocabulary server</I> is a network-accessible service that
maintains and documents a controlled vocabulary on behalf of the community.
Through a URL published on the OLAC web site it offers participating archives
access to the controlled vocabulary, such as through complete value lists that
can be downloaded or through an interactive interface that helps a user find an
appropriate value. For instance, SIL International has agreed to act as
controlled vocabulary server for language identifiers (see Simons 2000 for a
description of how this service will be rendered).</P>

<H3>3.6. Forming subcommunities for richer metadata standards</H3>
<P>The OLAC metadata set is not the final word on metadata in the language
archives community. In the same way that OLAC represents a specialized
subcommunity with respect to the entire Open Archives community, there are
specialized subcommunities within the scope of the OLAC community. For
instance, the ISLE Meta Data Initiative is developing a detailed metadata
scheme for corpora of recorded speech events and their associated descriptions
[<A
HREF="http://www.mpi.nl/world/ISLE/documents/draft/ISLE_Metadata_2.0.pdf">http://www.mpi.nl/world/ISLE/documents/draft/ISLE_Metadata_2.0.pdf</A>].
For archived language resources that of this kind, such a metadata scheme would
give much richer description.</P>
<P>The fact that the Open Archives Initiative framework provides a
means for archives to support multiple metadata standards means that it is
already possible for any OLAC archive to support multiple metadata standards,
and to participate in one or more other subcommunities.  Using the
OAI's metadata harvesting protocol, such a subcommunity can implement its own
service provider that offers focussed searching based on its rich metadata set.

</P>
<P>OLAC would support such subcommunities in two ways. First, through URLs
published on the OLAC web site, the availability and specialized services of
these subcommunities would be made known to the whole OLAC community. Second,
in the combined catalog of all OLAC holdings, the primary OLAC service provider
will keep track of what richer metadata formats are available for each
resource. This will allow it to augment the display of any resources having
richer metadata with a link to a site in the specialized subcommunity that
would give a display (and search access) based on the richer metadata.</P>

<h2>4. Founding the Open Language Archives Community</h2>

<h3>4.1. Standards governing the OLAC infrastructure</h3>

<p>
The previous section discussed the proposed OLAC Metadata Set.
This is to be a standard which governs the structure and interpretation
of the community-specific metadata that the OLAC gateway and OLAC service providers can
obtain from OLAC data providers.  The means by which this metadata is
obtained is covered by a separate standard, the OAI Metadata Harvesting
Protocol.  Together, these standards completely specify the interaction
which takes place in Figure 4, where two descending arrows meet the
data providers.

<p>
The two ascending arrows going to the OLAC gateway correspond to
yet another standard, the
<a href="community-provider.html">community provider protocol</a>,
which defines how data providers and service providers update and
query the OLAC registry.

<p>
OAI conformance requirements, most notably the Dublin Core Metadata Set,
constitute another source of OLAC standards.

<p>
One more standard is needed to complete the infrastructure.
This is a standard that governs the review practice.  The
most important contribution of this standard would be to
define the process by which a particular instance of advice
becomes adopted by the community as its expression of
recommended best practice.  We have a number of models for
this (for instance, the processes followed by the Worldwide
Web Consortium, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, and the
Internet Engineering Task Force).
 
<h3>4.2. OLAC Definition</h3>

<p>
<i>
The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) is the community of language
archives and associated services which implement the OLAC standards.
</i>

<p>
Note that at present the OLAC standards consist of the OAI
harvesting protocol, the OLAC metadata set, and the
community gateway protocol.  We anticipate that a standard
defining the review process will be added in time.

<p>
The purpose of OLAC is to support the community of people that we
have labelled the language documentation community, by fostering
the sharing of language resources.

<p>
Each OLAC archive will be asked to select a representative
to serve on an advisory council to help guide OLAC in the future.
As new issues arise concerning metadata sets and
protocols, council members will have a say in how the issues are addressed.

<h3>4.3. The OLAC Gateway</h3>

<p>
The OLAC gateway will be
<a href="/">http://www.language-archives.org</a>.
This site will host the documents which define the OLAC standards
including the schema for the OLAC Metadata Set.  The site will also
host the registry of data providers, an index of the service providers,
a list of controlled vocabulary servers, an archive of reviews, and
a collection of best practice recommendations.

<h3>4.4. The Primary OLAC Service Provider</h3>

<p>
As the foremost electronic network of linguists with over 13,000 members
worldwide, LinguistList
[<a href="http://www.linguistlist.org">http://www.linguistlist.org</a>]
will be the primary OLAC service provider, providing
a union catalog for the whole Open Language Archives Community.
LinguistList could also serve a key role in the review
process by hosting a mailing list and archive for OLAC reviews.
 
<h3>4.5. Peer review</h3>

<p>
It is usually difficult to judge the scale, quality and openness of a digital
resource and of the human and institutional support behind it.  Information
about available resources may be misleading, out-of-date, or erroneous, and
access to resources may be delayed or blocked by unadvertized restrictions.
Problems may be discovered with tools, formats and recommended best practices.
Members of any professional community eventually learn where to go for a
given service, although this knowledge is usually undocumented.  Given
the distributed nature of the language documentation community, we believe that
it would be helpful to institute an informal, open, peer review process,
which we sketch below.

<p>
Anyone who uses an OLAC service provider or data provider would be encouraged
to report their experience by completing a form available at the OLAC
Gateway.  The review would be
forwarded to the contact person for the provider, who could
post a response.  Visitors to the OLAC Gateway would be able to
peruse these reviews and responses.

<h3>4.6. Defining recommended best practice</h3>

<p>
In the framework we are proposing here, the review standard
defines the process whereby advice can be promoted to the
status of community-wide best practice recommendation.
 
<p>
OLAC Gateway will maintain a collection of Requests For Comment
(RFCs) and recommended best practices.
RFCs may report an existing practice and experience
with that practice, then present a case for wider adoption of the
practice.
RFCs may be accompanied with other materials, such as an XML DTD.
RFCs will typically be categorized by OLAC Metadata.

<p>
Anyone would be able to submit an RFC, and it would be dated and stored.
Anyone could comment on a submitted RFC using the review process described
above.  The OLAC Gateway would support a votebot, and anyone would be
free to vote on the RFC (accept, resubmit, reject).
Within six months of submission the RFC, reviews and votes would
be considered by the OLAC advisory council,
with the result: accept, resubmit, reject.

<p>
If a best practice is accepted, it is cited as recommended best practice
on the OLAC Gateway.  If the best practice is a data format, there will
usually be a corresponding XML DTD or Schema.

<p>
There could be multiple best practices concerning a given domain.
For example, several lexicon DTDs may end up being designated as
recommended best practice, and they may embody fundamentally distinct
approaches to the domain.  In this way, we hope that the recommendations
answer a community member's question: "what are some good ways of working
with materials of such and such a type?"  In this way, we hope to
eliminate some of the needless diversity which arises when the same wheel is
invented several times over by different groups who are unaware of
each other's existence, and which throws up a significant obstacle for
the reuse of data and tools.  At the same time, this process will not
restrict the necessary diversity which is a central part of scientific
innovation in the language documentation community.

<p>
Note that, over time, best practice recommendations may be replaced by
subsequent recommendations.


<h2>5. Next Steps</h2>

<p>
This White Paper has the status of a draft.  It will be revised based
on feedback received during the workshop, and then released at
the end.  Individuals and working groups are requested to give
comments to the authors.  Detailed comments would preferably be
given in writing.

<p>
Looking ahead, there are two ways in which the community can start
building OLAC right away.

<h3>5.1. Alpha test group</h3>

<p>
The OLAC metadata sets and the community provider protocols will need
to be tested and refined.  We hope to identify a small group of alpha testers
who are committed to building a conformant archive during the first half
of 2001.

<p>
<i>(A list of initial alpha testers, identified during the workshop,
will be given here.  An up-to-date list will be maintained on the
OLAC website.)
</i>

<p>
The alpha test group would function
like the advisory council in the early stages since they would
in fact be the participating archives and services.          

<h3>5.2. Call for Best Practice Recommendations</h3>

<p>
We solicit proposals for best practice recommendations.  These would
begin in the form of RFC documents, as described above.  Once they have
been discussed and approved, they will be posted on the OLAC Gateway
as recommended best practice.

<p>
The process by which such RFCs will be reviewed and then
potentially be adopted as best practice recommendations has yet
to be defined.  This process definition would be an important
early contribution of an OLAC advisory council.  In the
meantime, there is plenty of work to do in drafting RFCs and
informally reviewing them among colleagues.  Once the OLAC
review process is formalized and RFCs become adopted, they
would be posted on the OLAC gateway as recommended best practice.
