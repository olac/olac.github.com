<P> The Open Language Archives Community seeks to embrace all members of the
language resources community, from well-established institutional archives to
individuals who want to share research results. Would-be participants thus
operate in a wide variety of circumstances. In order to ensure that the barrier
to participation should be as low as possible, OLAC provides three approaches
to becoming an OLAC data provider. The following table summarizes the three
approaches and the circumstances each is designed for:</P>

</TABLE>
<P>The sections below describe each of the three approaches in more detail. A
final section discusses <A HREF="#Migration">migrating</A> from one approach to
another.</P>

<H2><A NAME="conventional"></A>Using the conventional approach</H2>

<P>If your archive has the metadata for its collection in an existing database
and if your institution has a Web server, then the best approach is to
implement a software interface that gives access to the metadata records
through the <A HREF="/OLAC/protocol.html"> OLAC Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting</A>. The advantage of this approach is that you need not maintain a
second version of your metadata in OLAC format; rather, the software you
implement will query the existing database to get the metadata information and
then dynamically return it in the format required by the OLAC standard. In
order to take full advantage of the OLAC standards and services it may be
desirable to add new information to the existing database (such as a way to
identify languages according the standard identifiers used by OLAC), but it
should not be necessary to maintain a duplicate version of any information in a
different format. </P>
<P>In order to pursue this approach, you will need to talk with the system
administrator for your institution's web server. Refer your system
administrator to the OLAC <A HREF="../tools.html">Tools</A> page for a list of
existing implementations in various programming languages.</P>
<P>When your metadata harvesting interface has been implemented, follow the
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html">OAI
registration procedure</A> to ensure that you have correctly implemented the
harvesting protocol. Once you are successfully registered as an OAI data
provider, proceed to the <A HREF="/register/archive.html">OLAC registration procedure</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Vida"></A>Using Vida: the Virtual Data Provider</H2>

<P> Vida, the OLAC <I>virtual data provider,</I> offers an OLAC-compliant
metadata harvesting interface to a metadata repository that is expressed as an
XML document. When your archive does not already have a metadata catalog in a
database, then you can use an XML editor with the DTD for an OLAC metadata
repository in order to construct such a catalog. Once you have created the XML
metadata repository, post it on a publicly accessible web site.</P>
<P>Once you repository file is web accessible, Vida is trivial to use.
Construct the baseURL of the metadata harvester by appending the URL of the XML
file to the URL of Vida, as follows: </P>
<PRE>
http://www.language-archives.org/vida/<FONT COLOR="red">yoursite.domain/path/yourfile.xml</FONT>
\________________ __________________/ \_______________ _______________/
                 V                                    V
           URL of virtual                        location of
           data provider                       your repository
</PRE>
<P>For instance, appending &quot;?verb=Identify&quot; to the above URL will
cause Vida to execute the Identify request against your metadata repository.
</P>
<P>In order to set up a data provider using this approach, you will need to
download this Document Type Definition:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The XML Schema for OLAC repositories:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.4/oryx.xsd">http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.4/oryx.xsd</A> </LI>
<LI>An example XML file using this schema:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.4/oryx.xml">http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/0.4/oryx.xml</A> </LI>
</UL>
<P>and use it with an XML editor of your
choice to build the XML representation of your metadata.
See, for instance, the
<A HREF="http://wdvl.com/Software/XML/editors.html">XML Software Guide</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xml.html#xmlEditing">XML Cover Pages</A>,
or <A HREF="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/xmltools/cat_ix.html#C_Editing">free
XML editors</A>.
</P>
<P>Once your repository file is posted at a publicly accessible URL,
proceed to the
<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/register/archive.html">
OLAC registration page</A>.</P>
<P> Here are some examples of XML metadata repositories: </P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/data/ldc.xml">LDC</A> -
Linguistic Data Consortium (~200 records) </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/data/ota.xml">OTA</A> - Oxford
Text Archive (~4000 records) </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/data/tdproject.xml">TDProject</A>
- Typology Project (~10 records) </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/data/tractor.xml">TRACTOR</A> -
TELRI archive (~100 records) </LI>
</UL>
<P>View these archives using the repository explorer on the
<a href="/community.php4">COMMUNITY</a> page.
</P>

<P>Questions about Vida should be addressed to
<a href="mailto:vida@language-archives.org">vida@language-archives.org</a>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ORE"></A>Using ORE: the OLAC Repository Editor</H2>

<P> A centralized forms-based service permits people to create and manage XML
repositories. This service is provided for those who do not have the capacity
to use an XML editor or to post an XML file to a local web site.  For
further information please see
the <A HREF="ore.html">ORE documentation</a>.

<P>During the editing process, the metadata repository is stored in a
relational database on the OLAC site. At any point, the repository can be
exported as an XML file, and <I>activated</I> to make it available for
harvesting. </P>

<P>Questions about ORE should be addressed to
<a href="mailto:ore@language-archives.org">ore@language-archives.org</a>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Migration"></A>Migration strategy</H2>

<P>As the circumstances of your archive change over time, it is easy to migrate
your implementation from one approach to another. The only constraint on
migration is that you should not change the unique identifier of your
repository. What will change as you migrate is the base URL for your data
provider. When you have a new implementation ready to go at a different base
URL, all you have to do to effect the migration is to re-<A
HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html">register at
OAI</A> with the new base URL, and then
re-<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/register/archive.html">register at OLAC</A>.
