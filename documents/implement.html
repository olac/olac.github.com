<p> The Open Language Archives Community seeks to embrace all members of
the language resources community, from well-established institutional archives
to individuals who want to share research results. Would-be participants
thus operate in a wide variety of circumstances. In order to ensure that
the barrier to participation should be as low as possible, OLAC provides
three approaches to becoming an OLAC data provider. The following table summarizes
the three approaches and the circumstances each is designed for. &nbsp;The
most widely used option at the present time is the second (Static Repositories).</p>

<p>The sections below describe each of the three approaches in more detail.
A final section discusses <a href="#Migration">migrating</a> from one approach
to another.</p>
  
<h2><a name="conventional"></a>Using the conventional approach</h2>
  
<p>If your archive has the metadata for its collection in an existing database 
and if your institution has a Web server, then the best approach is to implement
a software interface that gives access to the metadata records through the
<a href="/OLAC/protocol.html"> OLAC Protocol
for Metadata Harvesting</a>. The advantage of this approach is that you need
not maintain a second version of your metadata in OLAC format; rather, the
software you implement will query the existing database to get the metadata
information and then dynamically return it in the format required by the
OLAC standard. In order to take full advantage of the OLAC standards and
services it may be desirable to add new information to the existing database
(such as a way to identify languages according the standard identifiers used
by OLAC), but it should not be necessary to maintain a duplicate version
of any information in a different format. </p>
 
<p>In order to pursue this approach, you will need to talk with the system 
administrator for your institution's web server. Refer your system administrator
to the OLAC <a href="/tools.html">Tools</a>
page for a list of existing implementations in various programming languages.</p>
 
<p>When your metadata harvesting interface has been implemented, follow the 
<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html">OAI registration
procedure</a> to ensure that you have correctly implemented the harvesting
protocol. Once you are successfully registered as an OAI data provider, proceed
to the <a href="/register/archive.html">OLAC
registration procedure</a>.</p>
   
<h2><a name="Static"></a>Setting up static repositories</h2>
  
<p>The OLAC Static Repository Gateway offers an OLAC-compliant metadata harvesting
interface to a metadata repository that is expressed as an XML document.
When your archive does not already have a metadata catalog in a database,
then you can use an XML editor to construct such a catalog. On the other
hand, if your archive does already have a metadata catalog in a database,
you may want to export this data to a single XML file for harvesting by OLAC.
&nbsp;Once you have created the required static repository file, simply post
it on a publicly accessible web site.</p>
 
<p>Once you repository file is web accessible, the OLAC Static Repository
Gateway is trivial to use. Construct the baseURL of the metadata harvester
by appending the URL of the XML file to the URL of the
gateway as follows: </p>
 
<pre>http://www.language-archives.org/sr/<font color="red">yoursite.domain/path/yourfile.xml</font>
\_______________ _________________/ \_______________ _______________/
                V                                   V
           URL of static                       location of
        repository gateway                   your repository
</pre>
 
<p>For instance, appending "?verb=Identify" to the above URL will cause the
gateway to execute the Identify request against your static repository file.
&nbsp;Full details about static repositories and examples of existing static
repositories are available on the <a
 href="/tools.html">OLAC Tools</a> page.
&nbsp;Several existing OLAC static repositories can be browsed using the
<a href="/archives.php4">OLAC Archives</a>
page. &nbsp;For information about available XML editors, please see the <a
 href="http://wdvl.com/Software/XML/editors.html">XML Software Guide</a>, 
the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xml.html#xmlEditing">XML Cover
Pages</a>, or <a
 href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/xmltools/cat_ix.html#C_Editing">free 
XML editors</a>. </p>
 
<p>Once your repository file is posted at a publicly accessible URL, proceed
to the <a href="/register/archive.html"> OLAC
registration page</a>.</p>
   
<p>Questions about static repositories should be addressed to <a
 href="mailto:admin@language-archives.org">admin@language-archives.org</a>.</p>
  
<h2><a name="ORE"></a>Using ORE: the OLAC Repository Editor</h2>
  
<p> A centralized forms-based service permits people to create and manage
XML repositories. This service is provided for those who do not have the
capacity to use an XML editor or to post an XML file to a local web site.
 For further information please see the ORE page on the LINGUIST site at:
<a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/ore/">http://www.linguistlist.org/ore/</a>.
&nbsp;During the editing process, the metadata repository is stored in a relational
database on the LINGUIST site. At any point, the repository can be exported
as an XML file, and <i>registered</i> with OLAC to make it available for harvesting.
</p>
  
<p>Questions about ORE should be addressed to <a
 href="mailto:ore@language-archives.org">ore@language-archives.org</a>.</p>
  
<h2><a name="Migration"></a>Migration strategy</h2>
  
<p>As the circumstances of your archive change over time, it is easy to migrate 
your implementation from one approach to another. The only constraint on migration
is that you should not change the unique identifier of your repository. What
will change as you migrate is the base URL for your data provider. When you
have a new implementation ready to go at a different base URL, all you have
to do to effect the migration is to re-<a
 href="http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html">register
at OAI</a> with the new base URL, and then re-<a
 href="/register/archive.html">register at
OLAC</a>. </p>
