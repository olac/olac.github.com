        <h3>
            <a name="1"/>1. What is the Open Language Archives
            Community?</h3>
        <p>The <a href="/"> Open
                Language Archives Community</a>, or OLAC, is an
            international partnership of institutions and individuals
            who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language
            resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current
            practice for the digital archiving of language resources,
            and (ii) developing a network of interoperating
            repositories and services for housing and accessing such
            resources. OLAC was founded at the <a
                href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/expl2000/">
                Workshop on Web-Based Language Documentation and
                Description</a>, held in Philadelphia in December
            2000. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="2"/>2. What is a language resource?</h3>
        <p> A language resource is any kind of DATA, TOOL or ADVICE
            (see the <a href="/documents/vision.html">founding vision statement</a>)
            pertaining to the documentation, description or
            development
            of a human language. Texts, recordings, dictionaries,
            language learning materials,
            annotations, field notebooks, software, protocols, data
            models, file formats, newsgroup archives and web indexes
            are some examples of such resources. OLAC metadata can be
            used to describe any kind of language resource. Language
            resources may be digital or non-digital, published or
            restricted. In the OLAC context, a <i>language archive</i> is any collection of
            language resources and their resource descriptions. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="3"/>3. What is language resource discovery?</h3>
        <p> The most familiar methods for language resource discovery
            are mailing lists, web indexes, and the catalogs of
            archives and publishers. Users of these methods typically
            experience low precision and recall: one has to wade
            through many irrelevant resources, and relevant resources
            are easily overlooked. OLAC seeks to improve that
            situation by developing an infrastructure for language
            resource discovery. A key part of that infrastructure is a
            metadata set that is specialized for language resource
            description. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="4"/>4. What is metadata?</h3>
        <p> The simplest definition of metadata is "structured data
            about data." Metadata is descriptive information about an
            object or resource whether it be physical or electronic.
            While the term metadata itself is relatively new, the
            underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for
            as long as collections of information have been organized.
            Library card catalogs represent a well-established type of
            metadata; they have served as collection management and
            resource discovery tools for decades. Metadata can be
            generated either "by hand" or generated automatically
            using software. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="5"/>5. What is the OLAC metadata set?</h3>
        <p> The OLAC metadata set is the set of metadata elements that
            participating archives have agreed to use for describing language
            resources. Uniform description across archives is ensured
            by limiting the values of certain metadata elements to the
            use of terms from agreed-upon <a
                href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0105030">controlled
                vocabularies</a>. The OLAC metadata set is equally
            applicable whether the resources are available online or
            not. The metadata set consists of the fifteen elements of
            the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin
                Core Metadata Set</a>, plus the refinements and
            encoding schemes of the <a
                href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/"
                >DCMI Metadata Terms</a>&#x2014;a widely accepted
            standard for describing resources of all types. To this
            general standard, OLAC adds encoding schemes that are
            designed specifically for describing <i>language</i>
            resources, such as subject language and linguistic data
            type. The <a href="/NOTE/usage.html">OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines</a>
            describe (with examples) all the elements, refinements,
            and encoding schemes that may be used in OLAC metadata
            descriptions.
            The <a href="/OLAC/metadata.html">OLAC Metadata</a>
            standard defines the XML format that is used for the
            interchange of metadata descriptions among participating
            archives. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="6"/>6. How is OLAC metadata collected and disseminated?</h3>
        <p> OLAC metadata is collected (or "harvested") from participating archives
            every day using the <a
                href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm"
                > metadata harvesting protocol</a> of the <a
                href="http://www.openarchives.org/"> Open Archives
                Initiative</a> (OAI).  End users can access the
            metadata using OLAC's <a href="/search.html">search service</a>,
            or by browsing OLAC's language pages (coming soon).</p>
        <h3>
            <a name="7"/>7. Who can benefit from using OLAC metadata?</h3>
        <p> Anyone can use the OLAC Metadata Set to describe language
            resources. Language archives and language software
            repositories are the most common providers of OLAC
            metadata. (Participating archives and prospective
            participants are listed on the <a
                href="/organization.html">OLAC Organization</a> page.)
            Individual researchers will soon be able to document the
            resources they manage using a simple form interface. The
            whole language resources community will be empowered by
            OLAC metadata, being able to quickly identify relevant
            resources. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="8"/>8. What is meant by <i>Open</i> in the
            context of Open Language Archives? </h3>
        <p> OLAC is <i>open</i> in the sense that any archive can
            join, and any individual can access the metadata records
            of participating archives.  Participation and access are free.
            Also, the process by which OLAC governs itself and makes
            decisions is visible to all community members and open to
            their participation. <i>Open</i> does not mean that users
            are free to do whatever they like with the metadata, nor
            does it mean that the described language resources are
            openly available. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="9"/>9. How does a language archive join OLAC?</h3>
        <p> OLAC is open to participation by any language archive. To
            participate, archives must set up an OAI "data provider",
            exporting their catalogs to the Dublin Core and OLAC
            metadata formats for harvesting by the OAI Metadata
            Harvesting Protocol, and then register with the OAI and
            OLAC. In general, the catalog remains in its existing
            format (e.g. in a relational database) and a CGI script
            permits external services to harvest the records in the
            prescribed XML format. A second approach avoids the OAI
            protocol altogether. An entire metadata repository is
            dumped in a single XML file, and the OLAC virtual data
            provider takes care of the rest. For more information
            about both options, please see the page: <a
                href="implement.html">How to Become an OLAC Data
                Provider</a>. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="10"/>10. How are language standards like the TEI
            represented in OLAC?</h3>
        <p> In OLAC parlance, <i>standards</i> refer to procedures and
            formats that govern participating services, such as the
            OLAC Metadata Set or the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol.
            In OLAC, so-called "language standards" like the TEI are
            viewed as a kind of language resource called ADVICE since
            they are not binding on participating archives. OLAC follows a <a
                href="/OLAC/process.html">process</a> involving
            working groups and voting, whereby such advice can become
            identified as community-agreed best practice. </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="11"/>11. How do I contribute new proposals for
            OLAC metadata?</h3>
        <p> Please join the <a href="/wg/metadata/">OLAC Metadata
                working group</a> and post your proposal to the
            working group's mailing list. </p>
