<H1>The Seven Pillars of Open Language Archiving: A &nbsp;Vision Statement 
</H1>
<H2>Gary Simons and Steven Bird <BR>
Draft: 7 December 2000 </H2>
<HR>
<P> <I><B>About this document.</B><BR>
This document has been prepared in conjunction with the workshop on Web-Based
Language Documentation and Description, held in Philadelphia on 12-15 December
2000. It is an overall vision statement summarizing what individual users want
in terms of online language documentation and description, describing the gap
that currently exists between what users want and what they can get, and
finally painting a picture of how an Open Language Archives Community would
function to close that gap. </I> </P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Digital archiving of language documentation and description on the
World-Wide Web holds the promise of unparalleled access to language
information. But if it is not done well, it also offers the specter of
frustration and chaos on an unparalleled scale. This paper presents an
executive summary of our vision for the kind of infrastructure that would
unlock the promise. Special focus is given to the seven pillars on which such
an infrastructure would be erected.</P>
<P>The vision statement takes the form of a gap analysis. It begins by
describing the ideal situation we are aiming for. The next section describes
the actual situation we find today. The third section suggests what it would
take to bridge the gap that separates the actual from the ideal and concludes
by proposing the formation of an Open Language Archives Community as a way to
embody the needed infrastructure. The final section gives pointers to other
documents where the details of the proposal can be found.</P>
<H2>1. What individuals want&#151;the first three pillars</H2>
<P>The individuals who use and create language documentation and description
are looking for three things: data, tools, and advice. These are the first
three pillars on which the language archiving infrastructure must be
constructed:</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="90%" CELLSPACING="12" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR>
<TD>DATA</TD>
<TD>Information that documents or describes a language of interest</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>TOOLS</TD>
<TD>Computational resources that facilitate creating or using language data 
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>ADVICE&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>Help in knowing what data sources to rely on, what tools to use, and what
practices to follow</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>By DATA we mean any information that documents or describes a language. It
could take any form, such as a published monograph, a computer data file, or
even a shoe box full of hand-written index cards. The information could range
in content from unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed and annotated
texts to a complete descriptive grammar. </P>
<P>By TOOLS we mean computational resources that facilitate creating, viewing,
querying, or otherwise using language data. Tools include not just software
programs, but also the digital resources that the programs depend on, such as
fonts, stylesheets, and document type definitions.</P>
<P>By ADVICE we mean the kind of information an individual would typically
solicit when they need help. The language archive user might want help in
knowing what data sources are reliable versus which are not, help in knowing
what tools to use in a particular situation, or help in knowing what practices
to follow when creating new data.</P>
<P>Figure 1 shows a diagram summarizing the ideal situation in which the
individual user has access to whatever data, tools, and advice are needed.</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<H2>2. What individuals actually get&#151;the gap</H2>
<P>In actual fact today's user does not have ready access to the data, tools,
and advice that are needed. Figure 2 offers a diagramatic view of the reality.
Some archives (e.g. Archive 1) do have a site on the Internet which the user is
able to find, so the resources of that archive are accessible. Other archives
(e.g. Archive 2) are on the Internet, so the user could access them in theory,
but the user has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in practice.
Still other archives (e.g. Archive 3) are not even on the Internet. And there
are potentially hundreds of archives (e.g. Archive <I>n</I>) that the user
needs to know about. Tools and advice are out there as well, but are at many
different sites.</P>

<TD>Figure 2: In reality the user can't always get there from here</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Figure 2 only seeks to illustrate the difficulty posed by a multiplicity of
sites that may or may not be accessible. There are many other problems inherent
in the current situation. For instance, the user may not be able to find all
the existing data about the language of interest because different sites have
called it by different names. The user may not be able to use an accessible
data file for lack of being able to match it with the right tools. The user may
locate advice that seems relevant but have no basis for judging its merits.</P>
<H2>3. What a community could provide&#151;the other four pillars</H2>
<P>In order to bridge the gap, the individuals who use and create language
documentation and description need a community that provides four things: a
gateway, metadata, reviews, and standards. These are the remaining pillars on
which the language archiving infrastructure must be constructed:</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="90%" CELLSPACING="12" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR>
<TD>GATEWAY</TD>
<TD>A single portal through which users can access all available data, tools,
and advice</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>METADATA</TD>
<TD>Uniform descriptions of all available data, tools, and advice</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>REVIEWS</TD>
<TD>Peer evaluations of available data, tools, and advice </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>STANDARDS&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>Processes and protocols that enable the operation of the gateway and ensure
the quality of metadata and reviews</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>The GATEWAY is a single portal through which the user gains access to all
available data, tools, and advice. The actual data, tools, and advice are still
located on hundreds of sites all over the Internet, but the user need not know
about any of them. By accessing the single gateway site, the user gains access
to all available data, tools, and advice.</P>
<P>The secret to providing access to all available data, tools, and advice from
one gateway is METADATA. Metadata is not the data itself, but data about the
data. Thus even data that is not in digital form can openly be made known by
publishing its metadata. Each available instance of data, tools, or advice is
described in a metadata record that either includes a link to the full item or
instructions on how to obtain it. Specialized metadata elements are used to
meet requirements specific to language documentation like uniformly identifying
languages or like matching data formats to the appropriate tools. The
collection of all the available metadata records provides a combined catalog of
the holdings of all participating language archives.</P>
<P>The REVIEWS offer peer evaluations of available data, tools, and advice.
Peer review is an important function of any academic community and the language
documentation community is no exception. The members of the community need a
way to recommend good data, tools, and advice to their colleagues, as well as
to report any problems, incompatibilities, or the like. Users need to be able
to see these recommendations and warnings when they are searching the metadata
catalog.</P>
<P>The final pillar which makes it possible for the community to function is
STANDARDS. The standards are like a frame that encloses the core infrastructure
of the community. The actual data, tools, and advice lie outside that
frame&#151;these need not be constrained by a community standard. For the other
three pillars the opposite is the case; they must be governed by standards in
order for the community to function. The gateway is made possible through a
standard protocol for harvesting metadata from participating archives. The
metadata records are governed by a standard that ensures uniformity of coding
so that the metadata from hundreds of different sites can interoperate in a
single combined catalog. The review process is governed by a standard that at
one extreme makes it easy for any individual to post an evaluation, but at the
other extreme defines the means by which the community can speak with one voice
to recommend best practice to its members.</P>
<P>Figure 3 gives a diagram showing all seven pillars and how they relate. In a
graphical form it summarizes how a community would function to bridge the gap
between the individual user and all the data, tools, and advice that are out
there on the Internet. </P>

</TABLE>
<P>Specifically, we are proposing the formation of the Open Language Archives
Community. Based on a foundation that has already been laid by the Open
Archives Initiative [<A
HREF="http://www.openarchives.org">www.openarchives.org</A>], OLAC would add
community-specific standards that meet the special needs of those who use and
create language documentation and description.</P>
<H2>4. Going deeper&#151;the details</H2>
<P>This paper aims only to paint a high-level picture of the open language
archiving vision. Readers interested in digging into the details of the
proposal are referred to the following set of three papers (which also roughly
parallel the first three sections of this vision statement):</P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;<a href="requirements.html">Requirements on the Infrastructure for Open Language Archiving</a>&quot;
carefully documents the requirements that various sectors of the
community would levy on the overall solution.</LI>
<LI>&quot;<a href="survey.html">A Survey of the State of the Art in Digital Language Documentation
and Description</a>&quot; summarizes the current situation.</LI>
<LI>&quot;<a href="white-paper.html">White Paper on Establishing an Infrastructure for Open Language
Archiving</a>&quot; proposes the formation of the Open Language Archives
Community.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The requirements document completes the circle by explaining how the Open
Language Archives Community proposal addresses each of the identified
requirements.</P>
