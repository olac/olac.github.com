<h3>I. REQUIREMENTS ON OLAC METADATA</h3>

<p>
All OLAC metadata may be reproduced and distributed in
whole or in part, in any electronic medium, provided that the
terms of this license are adhered to, and that this
license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by
the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.

<p>Proper form for an incorporation by reference is to include the
following XML markup in the response to the Identify request as follows:

<pre>
    &lt;copyright>Copyright (c) YEAR Author(s) or designee&lt;/copyright>
    &lt;license>All metadata harvested from this data provider may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the OLAC License, available at http://www.language-archives.org/docs/license.html.&lt;/license>
</pre>

<p>
The reference must be immediately followed with any restrictions elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section IV).

<p>Unless stated otherwise, commercial redistribution of
OLAC metadata is permitted.

<p>
Distribution of OLAC metadata in any non-electronic form is prohibited
unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.

<p>
Distribution of substantively modified versions of OLAC metadata is
prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.
Substantive modification is any change to the semantic content of
OLAC metadata, excluding mere changes in format or typographical 
corrections.

<p>
All modified versions of OLAC metadata, including translations,
aggregations, and selections, must meet the following requirements:

<ol>
<li> The modified version must be labeled as such.
<li> The person/service making the modifications must be identified and the
modifications dated.
<li> Acknowledgement of the original author or authors
must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
<li> The OAI identifier of the original unmodified document must be given.
<li> The original author's or authors' name(s) may not be used to assert
or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original
author's (or authors') permission.
</ol>

<h3>II. COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p>
The copyright to each OLAC archive is owned by its author(s) or designee.

<h3>III. SCOPE OF LICENSE</h3>

The following license terms apply to all OLAC metadata, unless
otherwise explicitly stated.

<p>Mere aggregation of OLAC metadata or a portion of OLAC metadata
with other works or programs on the same media shall not
cause this license to apply to those other works.
The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the
OLAC metadata and appropriate copyright notice.

<p>SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license
remain in force.

<p>NO WARRANTY. OLAC metadata is licensed and provided "as
is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of
non-infringement.

<h3>IV. LICENSE OPTION</h3>

<p>The author(s) and/or publisher of any OLAC metadata may elect the
following option by appending language to the reference to or copy of the
license. This option is considered part of the license instance and must
be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in modified
works.

<p>
To prohibit any publication of the OLAC metadata for commercial purposes,
include the following XML markup in the response to the Identify request:

<pre>
   &lt;licenseRestriction type="non-commercial">
     Incorporation of the work or derivative of the work in any commercial
     service is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the
     copyright holder.
   &lt;/licenseRestriction>
