<h4>(I) Introduction:</h4>
<p>
The OLAC Repository Editor (ORE) is an online tool designed for
language archivists who wish to create an OLAC data provider.  ORE is a
particularly suitable option for potential data providers who have no existing catalog
database and who do not have a local website or XML capacity.
<p>
Before using ORE, the archivist
should become familiar with the goals of OLAC, and the notions of metadata,
OLAC Data Provider, and OLAC Service Provider.  The following items will be helpful:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/docs/overview.html">OLAC overview</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/implement.html">How to become an
OLAC Data Provider</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/OLAC/olacms.html">OLAC metadata
set</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/faq.html">OLAC Frequent Asked
Questions</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The interaction between the archivist and ORE may be broken down into three primary stages:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The archivist uses a simple forms-based editor provided by ORE to enter
information about their holdings.  The metadata is saved in a
database maintained by ORE, so the archivist may edit and modify the metadata as often as necessary.
</li>
<li>
At any time, the archivist may choose to "dump" the metadata into
an XML file.  Dumping simply involves clicking on a link; ORE does the
transformation of the metadata into an OLAC-compliant XML file automatically. 
</li>
<li>
Finally, the archivist may choose to <i>activate</i> an XML file that was
created in step (2), making it available for harvesting.  After harvesting, the
metadata of a repository will
be public and available to the OLAC community.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The prototype of ORE is located at:
<p>
<a href="/tools/ore/">
http://www.language-archives.org/tools/ore/</a>
<p>
The rest of this help page will guide the user through the various pages found
in ORE.  It is recommended that the user have ORE running while reading through this guide.
<p>
<br>
<a name = login><h4>(II) Login</h4></a>
<p>
The login page is displayed at each fresh entry into the ORE web page (when
the web browser is restarted).  To use ORE, each user must have
a unique email address and password.  
<p>
A new user needing to register an email address and password should click on the "please
register first" link on the login page.
<p>
<br>
<a name = registerform><h4>(III) Registration</h4></a>
To register with ORE, provide a Contact email, Contact person and password.  Note: Since ORE repositories cannot
be shared between users, multiple maintainers of a single repository must share
the same account, and must avoid editing the same record simultaneously.
<p>
Once a user has registered, a confirmation notice will be sent to the address
provided as the Contact email.  At the same time, the newly registered user will be
redirected back to the login page and may then log in.
<p>
<br>
<a name = home><h4>(IV) ORE Main Page</h4></a>
<p>
The ORE Main Page is the "home" page which a registered ORE user sees
upon logging in.  The Main Page lists all the repositories (if any) for a particular
user, and provides a link for reserving a new <i>repository identifier</i> (see
below for explanation).  
<p>
The various links and buttons accessible from the Main Page are as follows
(but note that only the first item will appear if there has been no repository created):
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a name=reserverepoid><b>Click here to reserve a new repository identifier</b></a><br>
To begin creating a repository, a repository identifier must first be reserved.
This will allow OLAC to uniquely identify the repository.  The user will be
directed to a form to select a repository idenfier.  ORE
maintains a record of all identifiers and will provide error messages should
the user select an existing identifier.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>View</b><br>
Provides a view of the XML file of an activated repository (this link will only
appear if a repository has been activated).
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Save</b><br>
Prompts the user to save the XML file of an activated repository to the user's local hard disk (this link will only appear if a repository has been activated).
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Activation</b><br>
Goes to the <a href=#activaterepo>ORE Activation Area</a> for the
selected repository.  From the Activation Area, the user may choose to activate
one of the XML files that has been created, or to deactivate an active file. 
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Work Area</b><br>
Goes to the <a href=#repoworkarea>ORE Work Area</a> for the
selected repository.  From that page, users may create, edit or delete records
within the repository, edit metadata information about the repository, or dump records into an
XML file.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Delete Repo</b><br>
Removes the repository from the ORE database.  Note that the
repository must be EMPTY before it can be deleted.
<p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
<br>
<a name=repoworkarea><h4>(V) ORE Work Area</h4></a>
The ORE Work Area is accessed by clicking on one of the "Work Area"
buttons for a particular repository identifer listed on the Main page.  
<p>
If a newly-created identifier is selected, the Work Area will provide a "Click
here to create a repository for this identifier" link.  By clicking on this
link, the user will be forwarded to a <a href=#createeditrepo>Create/Edit
Repository Information</a> page. This page contains a form which the user fills out,
providing metadata information about the repository to be created.  
<p>
Once the form is submitted, the user is returned to the Work Area.  The Work
Area wil now provide more options for the user:
<p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Create/Edit Records</b><br>
Sends the user to the
<a href=#createeditrecord>Create/Edit Records</a> page.  From
there, the user will have various options of working on the records within the
selected repository.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Edit Repository Information</b><br>
Sends the user to the <a href=#createeditrepo>Create/Edit
Repository Information</a> page, where metadata information about the
repository may be edited.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Dump Repository in XML</b><br>
Writes repository metadata into an XML file.  The user will then be
automatically forwarded to the <a href=#activaterepo>ORE Activation
Page</a>, where the recently dumped XML file may be activated if so desired.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Upload XML File into Repository</b></a></br>
Allows users to upload an OLAC-compliant XML file into the repository.  The
metadata will be parsed and stored in the ORE database.  All subsequent
metadata editing and activation may be done within ORE.
<p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
<br>
<h4><a name=createeditrepo>(VI) Create/Edit Repository Information</a></h4>
This page provides a form which a user fills out in order to create a
repository.  Elements marked * are mandatory, as required by OLAC.  The user may
subsequently edit the information on this page from the Work Area page by
clicking on the "Edit Repository Information" link.
<p>
Short explanation for each field is provided and the names of most elements are
also clickable links which will pop open a description help page explaining the
expected information for each element.
<p>
<br>



<h4><a name=createeditrecord>(VII) Create/Edit Records</a></h4>
From the Create/Edit Records page, the user may choose to carry out various
<i>record level</i> operations for the selected repository.  This includes
creating, editing, copying, renaming and deleting records within the repository:

<ul>

<li>
<b>Create</b><br>
Creates a new record for the repository.  Each record must have a <i>Record
Id</i> that is unique to the repository.  The user may choose to enter a unique
personalized Record Id in the text field provided, and then clicking the "Create" button.
Alternatively, the field may be left blank, in which case ORE will
automatically assign a unique numerical Record ID when the "Create" button is clicked.
Clicking the "Create" button will send the user to the <a
href=#recordeditor>Record Editor</a> page. 
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Edit</b><br>
Enters the <a href=#recordeditor>Record Editor</a> page to edit the
metadata for the selected record.
<p>
</li>


<li>
<a name = copyrenamedeleterecord><b>Copy</b><br></a>
Sends the user to the <b>Copy Record</b> page.  To copy a record, provide a new
unique record ID to copy to.  Alternatively, leave the field blank and a
numerical Record ID will be automatically assigned.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Rename</b><br>
Sends the user to the <b>Rename Record ID</b> page. To rename a record ID, provide a
new unique record ID.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Delete</b><br> 
Sends the user to the <b>Delete Record</b> page.  Confirm the deletion by pressing the
"Delete" button, or press the "Cancel" button to return to the Create/Edit
Records page without any changes.
<p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
<br>
<a name=recordeditor><h4>(VIII) Record Editor</h4></a><br>
The ORE Record Editor page provides a form which allows the user to create and edit metadata information
for a record within a repository.  The fields on the form correspond to the
OLAC metadata elements.  Read more about OLAC metadata set <a href="/OLAC/olacms.html">here</a>.
<p>
None of the elements are mandatory and may be left blank.
Multiple entries are permitted for every element.  To key in multiple entries
for an element, fill in the information for one entry, then click on the
corresponding "More" button provided on the right hand side.  An additional blank
field will appear immediately below.
<p>
Each element name is clickable and will pop open a description help page explaining
the expected information for each element.
<p>
The buttons below the form serve the following functions:
<p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>SAVE AND EXIT</b><br>
Saves all form data to the ORE database, and
returns the user to the Create/Edit Records page.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>EXIT WITHOUT SAVING</b><br>
Returns to the Create/Edit Records page without saving.
<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>CLEAR FORM</b><br>
Clears all values from the form.
<p>
</li> 

<li>
<b>[VIEW XML]</b><br>
Sends the user to the View Record in XML page.  
<p>
<a name = viewsavexmlrecord><b>View Record in XML</b>:<br></a>
This page displays an XML version of the
information entered on the form (This is intended solely for users interested
in viewing the XML output of their records.  Knowledge of XML is however not
required for using ORE.  It should be noted that the
XML displayed here is only for one record, and is not a full representation of
the XML file that ORE will generate for the entire repository).
<p>
To return to the Record Editor page without saving, click on the "Back to Form"
button.
<p>
</li>

</ul>


<p>
<br>

<a name = importxml><h4>(IX) Upload XML file into Repository</h4></a>
<p>
The upload facility is designed for users who have their own OLAC-compliant XML files
but who might wish to edit and activate the files through ORE.  This page
provides the user with an upload form.  The appropriate XML file on a local server
may be selected by clicking on the "Browse" button.  Assuming that the file is
valid, ORE will parse the XML and store the metadata on the ORE database, and
the user will be forwarded to the <a href="#createeditrecord">Create/Edit
Record page</a>.  The user may then edit the uploaded repository in the usual
way through ORE.
<p>
To upload an XML file, the user must have already reserved a Repository
Identifier through ORE.  See the <a href ="#reserverepoid">Reserve Repository
Identifer</a> section for further details.  The &lt;repositoryIdentifier&gt;
element in the XML file MUST be the same as the reserved identifier in order
for the upload to succeed.
<p>
Furthermore, ORE will validate all XML files uploaded to make sure that they are
OLAC-compliant.  Non-compliant files will be flagged and the upload aborted.

<p>
<br>

<a name=activaterepo><h4>(X) ORE Activation Area</h4></a>
The ORE Activation Area is accessed by clicking on one of the "Activation Area"
buttons for a particular repository listed on the Main page.  A user is also
automatically directed to the Activation Area after "dumping" a repository in
XML, an operation which is done from the Work Area.
<p>
If the user has yet to dump any repositories into XML, the Activation Area will be empty.
<p>
Otherwise, the user will see a table listing all the XML files that have been
created for the particular repository.  Also listed are: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Date and Time of Dump</b><br>
This lists the date and time of the XML dumps for each file.
</li>

<li>
<b>Date and Time of the latest record update</b><br>
This lists the last 
time one of the records belonging to the repository was updated using the 
ORE Record Editor
</li>

<li>
<b>Status</b><br>
- A file is listed as UP TO DATE if the XML dump is 
more recent than th latest record update<br>
-A file is listed as ACTIVE if it is the activated file
</li>

<li>
<b>View</b><br>
Sends the user to the <a name = viewxmlrepo><b>View Repository in XML</b></a> page.<br>
This page displays the OLAC-compliant XML file for the repository.  
</li>

<li>
<b>Save</b><br>
Prompts the user to save the XML file to the local hard disk.</a>
</li>

<li>
<b>Delete</b><br>
Deletes the corresponding XML file.  An active file cannot be deleted.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The user may select a file to activate by clicking on the radio button next to
a particular file, and then pressing Submit.  The selected XML file will then be
flagged as the "active repository" and displayed above the table.
<p>
ORE permits users to "harvest" an active repository on demand.  After
harvesting, the metadata of the active repository can be searched alongside
metadata from other active repositories, using an OLAC service provider
(see the <a href="/tools.html">TOOLS</a> page).  Note that each OLAC
service provider will harvest the active repository according to its own
harvesting schedule.  It may take a day or two before the metadata appears in
these service providers. 
<p>
To harvest the active repository, simply click on the "Harvest Active
Repository" button that is provided.  Once a harvest is complete, a link will be provided to the OLAC Service
Provider at U.Penn.
<p>
Note that this on-demand harvesting is slow, and users will usually not need to
do this more than once or twice.
