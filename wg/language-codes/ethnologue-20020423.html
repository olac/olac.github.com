A paper presented at the International Workshop on Resources and Tools in
Field Linguistics, LREC 2002 (26-27 May 2002, Las Palmas, Canary Islands).
</b></i>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>A foundational aspect of documenting an endangered language and
preserving that documentation for long-term access is identifying the
language itself. The web version of the <i>Ethnologue</i> has become
the de facto standard for identifying the more than 6,800 languages
spoken in the world today. The system of three-letter codes that
uniquely identify each language has been used within SIL for nearly
three decades as an in-house standard, but now there is increasing
demand for these codes to be used by other organizations and
projects. This paper describes four changes that SIL International is
implementing in order to make its set of language identification codes
better meet the needs of the wider community. The changes seek to
strike a balance between becoming more open while at the same time
becoming more disciplined.

<h2>The need for language identifiers</h2>

<p>A foundational aspect of documenting an endangered language and
preserving that documentation for long-term access is identifying the
language itself. Effective retrieval of resources depends on the
uniform identification of the languages to which they pertain. Simply
using language names in metadata is not adequate since the same
language is typically known by many names and those names change over
time. Furthermore, different languages may be known by the same
name. Thus the most effective approach in resource metadata is to use
standardized language identifiers. See Simons (2000) and Bird and
Simons (2001, section 3.4.1) for a fuller discussion of this point.

<p>The International Organization for Standardization has published a
standard for three-letter codes to identify languages (ISO
1998). Known as ISO 639-2, it provides codes for fewer than 400
languages. Thus language documentation efforts (such as
ISLE<sup>1</sup>, E-MELD<sup>2</sup>,
OLAC<sup>3</sup>, and Rosetta Project<sup>4</sup>) that embrace endangered languages have had
to look elsewhere for language identifiers.  They have turned to the
most widely known and accessed reference work on language
identification, the <i>Ethnologue</i> (Grimes 2000), now in its
14<sup>th</sup> edition. With listings for over 7,000 languages, the
<i>Ethnologue</i> seeks to give a comprehensive accounting of all
known living and recently extinct languages in the world. Other
languages, such as ancient and constructed languages, are specifically
outside the scope of the <i>Ethnologue</i>; SIL International is
pleased to cooperate with the Linguist List initiative to develop
standardized codes for these languages that fall outside the scope of
the <i>Ethnologue</i> (Aristar 2002).

<h2>The development of an in-house standard</h2>

<p>The system of three-letter language identifiers used in the
<i>Ethnologue</i> was originally developed as a standard for in-house
use almost 30 years ago. The codes were first published with the
following explanation in a monograph reporting the results of building
a database of languages of the world from the typesetting tapes for
the 7<sup>th</sup> edition (1969) of the <i>Ethnologue</i>:

<blockquote>
Each language is given a three-letter code on the order of
international airport codes. This aids in equating languages across
national boundaries, where the same language may be called by
different names, and in distinguishing different languages called by
the same name. (Grimes 1974:i)
</blockquote>

<p>While the codes were used in the database that generated the
8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> editions of the <i>Ethnologue</i>,
it was not until the 10<sup>th</sup> edition that they appeared in the
publication itself. The introduction offers this explanation:

<blockquote>
Each language of the world is assigned a unique three-letter code,
which is the same in all countries in which that language is
spoken. The code helps distinguish the language from other languages
with similar names and helps to insure that each language will be
counted only once in a world or area statistics. (Grimes 1984:iii)
</blockquote>

<p>This system of three-letter codes for identifying languages has
been an in-house standard within SIL for nearly three decades. Though
the codes were available to the public in print publications, the
publications were not widely known.  This changed dramatically in 1996
with the publication of a web version of the 13<sup>th</sup> edition
of the <i>Ethnologue</i> on the Internet. Before that there were only
a few thousand copies of the print publication in circulation. The web
edition brought an overnight change with thousands of people
consulting the <i>Ethnologue</i> every day.

<h2>Becoming a community standard</h2>

<p>Today with over one million page hits per month on
www.ethnologue.com, the <i>Ethnologue</i> has become a de facto
standard for worldwide use. SIL International is responding to this
shift from being an in-house standard to becoming a community standard
by making changes to the way it manages the three-letter code set.

<p>There are four key changes that are being implemented in order to
make the SIL language identification codes better meet the needs of
the global community. In sum, the changes seek to strike a balance
between becoming more open while at the same time becoming more
disciplined. The four changes are:

<ol>
<li>Opening access to the complete code set by making it downloadable
<li>Opening the process by which corrections and improvements are made to the <i>Ethnologue</i>
<li>Tightening the definition of the criteria used for identifying languages
<li>Tightening the policies surrounding changes to the code set
</ol>

<p>The remaining sections describe each of these changes in turn,
first discussing the requirements that lie behind the change, and then
detailing the solution that is being implemented for it.

<h2>Opening access to the complete code set</h2>

<p>Heretofore, the three-letter language identifier has been included
as part of the <i>Ethnologue's</i> description of each language, but
the codes have not been published separately as a code set. In
particular, organizations and projects that want to use the codes in
their own application require the following:

<ul>
<li>Users need the complete code set in a form that can be downloaded
and in turn imported into a database or other application.

<li>In addition to the codes themselves, users need to be able to
incorporate associated information like countries and alternate names
into their applications in order to assist in finding the right code.
</ul>

<p>SIL International has responded to these requirements by publishing
the entire set of language identifiers as a set of tab-delimited
tables that can be downloaded for import to a database or other user
application (SIL 2002). The structure of the tables (described in SQL
statements for creating the database tables) is as follows:

<pre> 
CREATE TABLE LanguageCodes (
   LangID      char(3) NOT NULL,        -- Three-letter code
   CountryID   char(2) NOT NULL,        -- Main country where used 
   LangStatus  char(1) NOT NULL,        -- L(iving), N(early extinct),
                                        -- E(xtinct)
   Name        varchar(75) NOT NULL)    -- Primary name in that country 

CREATE TABLE CountryCodes (
   CountryID   char(2) NOT NULL,        -- Two-letter code from ISO3166
   Name        varchar(75) NOT NULL )   -- Country name

CREATE TABLE LanguageIndex (
   LangID      char(3) NOT NULL,        -- Three-letter code for language
   CountryID   char(2) NOT NULL,        -- Country where this name is used 
   NameType    char(2) NOT NULL,        -- L(anguage), LA(lternate),
                                        -- D(ialect), DA(lternate)
   Name        varchar(75) NOT NULL )   -- The name
</pre>

<p>The LanguageCodes table lists 7,148 distinct language
identifiers. Of these, 308 represent extinct languages, 406 are nearly
extinct, and the remainder are listed with &quot;living&quot;
status. The following shows the entries for the first six languages
identifiers in the download table:

<pre> 
LangID CountryID LangStatus Name          
------ --------- ---------- ------------- 
AAA    NG        L          Ghotuo
AAB    NG        L          Arum-tesu
AAC    PG        L          Ari
AAD    PG        L          Amal
AAE    IT        L          Albanian, Arbëreshë
AAF    IN        L          Aranadan
</pre>

<p>We see that AAA and AAB denote living languages spoken in Nigeria,
AAC and AAD denote living languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, and so
on. When a language is actually spoken in more than one country, the
CountryId gives the country that is considered primary; usually the
country of origin or country where most of the speakers are located.

<p>The CountryCodes table lists the two-letter identifier and name for
220 countries of the world. The codes are from the international
standard known as ISO 3166-1 (ISO 1997). The following shows the
entries for the first five codes in the list:

<pre> 
CountryID Name    
--------- --------------------- 
AD        Andorra
AE        United Arab Emirates
AF        Afghanistan
AG        Antigua and Barbuda
AI        Anguilla
</pre>

<p>The LanguageIndex table documents 37,420 distinct names used for
the 7,148 languages. Each entry in this index of names indicate the
country in which the name is used. The table thus contains 46,416
records since many of the names are used in more than one country and
some are used with more than one language or dialect. The following
shows the entries in the name index for the first three language
identifiers

<pre> 
LangID CountryID NameType Name 
------ --------- -------- ------------- 
AAA    NG        L        Ghotuo
AAA    NG        LA       Otuo
AAA    NG        LA       Otwa
AAB    NG        LA       Alumu
AAB    NG        D        Arum
AAB    NG        LA       Arum-cesu
AAB    NG        LA       Arum-chessu
AAB    NG        L        Arum-tesu
AAB    NG        D        Tesu
AAC    PG        L        Ari
</pre>

<p>We see that AAA has two alternate names in addition to the primary
name of Ghotuo. AAB has three alternate names and two dialect names in
addition to its primary name. AAC has just one name.

<p>Using this table it is possible to build queries that retrieve sets
like all the languages spoken in a particular country, all the
countries in which a particular language is spoken, all the languages
known by a particular name, or all the names by which a given language
is known. When the information provided in these tables is not enough
for someone using the codes to be absolutely sure that a proposed code
is the right one for a particular language, the user interface for the
application can offer a link to the Ethnologue web site in order to
retrieve a report giving all of the information available on the
proposed code. The link is as follows, where AAA is the proposed
three-letter identifier:

<pre> 
http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AAA
</pre>

<h2> Opening the process for changing the <i>Ethnologue</i></h2>

<p>The <i>Ethnologue</i> is a work in progress; our knowledge of the
world's languages is always incomplete and subject to
improvement.  Many people who use the <i>Ethnologue</i> can give
feedback that will make it better and SIL International has always
valued this kind of input. Users may have more accurate information on
details like locations or names or population figures or language
development status. Or they may be able to provide information that
would lead to a change to the set of language identifiers. For
instance, they may be able to show that what is treated as one
language is really two, or vice versa, or that a listed language does
not exist or that an existing language is not listed.

<p>It should be easy for any user of the web version of the
<i>Ethnologue</i> to give feedback that will help to improve the
quality of the language descriptions and the set of language
identifiers. The <i>Ethnologue</i> staff welcomes such input and has
an established process for dealing with it. This process involves
verifying the information with correspondents in the field, and thus
the process is not always a fast one. The current <i>Ethnologue</i>
web site contains a questionnaire for reporting a language
description, but it is too hard to locate and too complex for giving
basic feedback. These are some requirements on improving the process
for proposing changes to the <i>Ethnologue</i>:

<ul>
<li>The web page which shows the <i>Ethnologue</i> report for a
particular language should have a link or button on it that invites
the user to give feedback that will help to improve the treatment of
that language.

<li>The user giving feedback should provide basic information such as
name, affiliation, and an email address so that the <i>Ethnologue</i>
staff may contact the contributor for follow-up.

<li>The user giving feedback should receive an explanation of the
process that will be used to process the input.

<li>The <i>Ethnologue</i> staff should notify the contributor of the
eventual outcome of the change proposal.

<li>From the web page for a particular language, any user should be
able to see a list of the changes that will be made in the next
edition of the <i>Ethnologue</i>.
</ul>

<p>The plan is to incorporate these facilities into the
<i>Ethnologue</i> web site; at the time of writing they have not yet
been implemented.

<h2>Tightening the criteria for identifying language</h2>

<p>As the process for making changes to the <i>Ethnologue</i> is
opened up for wider input, it is imperative that the criteria used for
identifying languages are clear to all who are giving input since
there are so many different notions of what it means to be a different
language. The introduction to the <i>Ethnologue</i> summarizes the
problem like this:

<blockquote>
How many languages are spoken in the world today? No one really
knows. What is a language? The term has been used in many different
senses. Popular usage often reserves the term `language' for the
major, prestigious speech forms of the world, and uses `dialect' for
everything else. Some people use `language' to refer to speech forms
that share a certain percentage of similar vocabulary, and `dialect'
to refer to speech forms that share higher percentages. Or they may
consider varieties to constitute the same language which have similar
grammatical and phonological systems. Many people, including some
linguists, use the terms `language' and `dialect' without always
clarifying the sense in which they are being used. (Grimes 2000:vii)
</blockquote>

<p>Constable and Simons (2000) discuss the problems involved in
developing a standardized code set for identifying all the world's
languages. We conclude that many different code sets are possible
since different users have different operational definitions of
language based on the different purposes they have for identifying
languages. Thus one of the most basic challenges involved in developed
a set of language identifiers is to establish an operational
definition for language and then to assign identifiers consistently on
the basis of that definition. A set of language identifiers that
merely assigns codes based on the whim of editors and users would not
be very useful. The requirements on criteria definition are thus as
follows:

<ul>
<li>The criteria that will be used by the editors to determine whether
two speech varieties should be listed as different languages or as
varieties of the same language must be clearly stated.

<li>When users of the code set propose changes to particular language
identifiers, they should do so by demonstrating that the criteria were
not applied appropriately in the particular situation. Such changes
(once validated) should be made by the editors.

<li>When users of the code set propose changes because they disagree
with the criteria themselves, these changes should not be made (unless
there is first a decision to refine the criteria and then to reapply
them consistently throughout the entire code set).
</ul>

<p>This leads us to ask what the <i>Ethnologue</i> already says
regarding its criteria for identifying languages. While the
introduction falls short of giving an operational definition, it does
discuss some of the factors. The one given the most weight is
intelligibility:

<blockquote>
To those of us who are interested in cross-cultural communication
and developing usable literature for speakers of many languages,
however, it seems clear that one of the main factors that must be
considered in distinguishing `language' from `dialect' is how well two
linguistically close speech communities understand each
other. Marginal intelligibility between two language communities does
not allow their speakers to engage in meaningful communication beyond
bare essentials. (Grimes 2000:vii)
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to identifying the key factor, this statement also
identifies the purpose that underlies language identification as
carried out by the <i>Ethnologue</i> - it is based on a motivation
of "developing usable literature for speakers of many
languages." Another key statement is the following:

<blockquote>
Variants of the language that are not distinct enough to need
separate literature are treated as dialects, and are listed under the
language entry and not as separate entries, unless attitudes or other
social factors are strong enough that they need to be treated as
separate sociolinguistic entities. (Grimes 2000:vii)
</blockquote>

<p>From these statements we see that the main criteria are these
three: intelligibility, shared literature, and social factors
(especially having to do with ethnolinguistic attitudes and
identity). A more operational definition of how these factors are used
in decision making might be stated as follows:

<ul>
<li>If two related varieties share intelligibility and already share a
common literature, they are considered the same language.

<li>Conversely, if two related varieties use literatures that are not
intelligible to each other, they are considered to be different
languages.

<li>Where there is no literature, then two related varieties are
considered to be the same language if they share intelligibility and
they share the same ethnolinguistic identity.

<li>
Where there is intelligibility but such a strong sense of distinct
identity as to make the use of shared literature infeasible, the
varieties are considered to be different languages.
</ul>

<p>More work needs to be done by the <i>Ethnologue</i> staff to
refine these criteria statements. No doubt further points will need to
be added in order to handle all known cases. However, the formulation
given here should suffice to indicate the basic criteria being used at
present and to illustrate the direction we want to go in stating our
decision-making criteria more clearly.

<h2>Tightening policies for changing the code set</h2>

<p>The code set needs to change over time, not only because languages
change, but more often because our knowledge about the languages of
the world (especially the small and endangered languages) is improving
all the time. While the code set was only an in-house standard,
changes were made without a lot of attention to the impact of changes
in the meaning or a code or the impact of recycling a previously used
code.

<p>Now that other organizations are using the code set as a standard
in their own applications, SIL International must become more
disciplined about how changes to the code set are implemented and
documented. These are the main requirements on the process of managing
changes to the code set:

<ul>
<li>Once a language code has been used in the code set, it may never
be reused. In this way, user data that uses the code may become
obsolete when the code is retired, but never unexpectedly change in
meaning (such as if the code were reused for another purpose).

<li>Once a language code has been correctly applied to tag an item in
user data, it must continue to be the right code to use for that item
for as long as the code remains an active member of the code set.

<li>Users who support applications that use the language codes need to
be able to find out how the code set has changed. Furthermore, they
need an automated way to find all the data records that may no longer
be correctly coded (such as when codes are retired or shift in their
range of meaning). For each affected code, there should be an
indication of how existing data may need to be changed.
</ul>

<p>The code management discipline being followed in order to satisfy
the first bullet is self evident. The second bullet requires more
explanation. When two codes are merged into one, one code is permitted
to remain with an extended meaning while the other is retired. This is
allowed since all application data previously coded with the code that
has been extended in meaning is still correctly coded. However, when
the reverse happens (that is, one code needs to be split into two),
the original code is retired and two new codes are created. If the
original code were retained with a narrower meaning, then some of the
existing uses of the code would no longer be valid, thus breaking the
second requirement above.

<p>The third requirement is being met by publishing a change history
table along with the downloadable code table (SIL 2002). The current
plan is to release an updated code table twice per year (on or around
January 15 and July 15), With each update a downloadable change
history table will also be released. The SQL statement for creating
the change history table is as follows:

<pre>
CREATE TABLE ChangeHistory (
   Code         varchar(10) NOT NULL,  -- The affected three-letter code
   Type         char(1) NOT NULL,      -- C(reated), E(xtended),
                                       -- R(etired), (U)pdated
   Date         char(10) NOT NULL,     -- Date of public release
   Description  varchar(255) )         -- Description of change 
</pre>

<p>Note that four types of changes are tracked. C is for a code that
is newly created. E is for a code that is extended in meaning; the
description should tell which other code was merged into it. R is for
a code that has been retired; the description should tell which other
code or codes replace it. U is for a code for which information in the
LanguageCode table has been updated; the code and its meaning have not
changed, but the name or country or status of the language has been
changed. Here are some sample rows from the ChangeHistory table:

<pre>
Code Type Date        Description
---- ---- ----------  ----------------------------------------
AOX  C    2002-01-31  Add ATORADA, Guyana, living
APR  E    2002-01-31  Includes [LOA] which was retired
LOA  R    2002-01-31  Merge with [APR]; change all [LOA] to [APR]
AWG  R    2002-01-31  Same as [WMI]; change all [AWG] to [WMI]
CKN  R    2002-01-31  Unable to verify existence; delete from database
AAS  U    2002-01-31  Change from extinct to living
BCJ  U    2002-01-31  Change name from BAADI to BARDI
</pre>

<p>The ChangeHistory table holds the cumulative list of all changes
that have been made to the code set. Thus it may be queried to learn
the complete history of a given code, or to learn all the changes that
have been made since a given date. Another key use of the
ChangeHistory table is in discovering all the codes in an application
data set that are now obsolete and thus need to be changed. These will
be the codes that are marked as retired in the change history
table. Thus a full list of all data records needing to be changed can
be found by doing a JOIN on the change history table. For instance, if
the column named Code in MyTable holds a three-letter language code,
then the following SQL statement will select all records that have
been rendered out-of-date by changes to the code set made since the
beginning of 2002:

<pre>
SELECT * FROM MyTable M, ChangeHistory C
WHERE M.code=C.Code AND C.Type='R' AND C.Date &gt;=2002-01-01 
</pre>

<p>Note that the Description field of the joined result set will
describe what needs to be done to bring each offending language code
up-to-date.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Language identification is a foundational aspect of documenting an
endangered language and preserving that documentation for long-term
access. This is because effective retrieval of archived language
resources depends on the uniform identification of the languages to
which they pertain. The system of three-letter language identification
codes used in the <i>Ethnologue</i> is proving to be a useful tool for
this purpose, and will be even more useful when it can be managed more
as a community standard than as an in-house standard. SIL
International is therefore endeavoring to implement the changes
described in this paper in hopes of better serving the language
resources community.
