<h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>

<p>
The workgroup's aim is to produce a supplementary set of language codes that 
will, in conjunction with the Ethnologue's set, constitute a complete set of codes 
for all languages of which there is any historical or current record. To this end, it 
describes a proposal for supplementing Ethnologue's set with codes for ancient  
and constructed languages.  It discusses the criteria for the Ethnologue codes, 
and how these might, with modifications, be extended to ancient and constructed 
languages. It then lists a proposed set of criteria by which codes should be 
assigned to ancient and constructed languages.

<h2>The Ethnologue Codes</h2>

<p>
The most complete set of language codes in existence is the Ethnologue system 
(<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/">http://www.ethnologue.com/</a>),
produced and maintained by the Summer Institute 
of Linguistics.   This system assigns a 3-letter code to every distinct natural 
language in existence.  As noted by Constable and Simons 2001[1], the 
Ethnologue attempts to:

<ol>
<li> Consistently apply an operational definition of language so that all entities 
for which an identifier is assigned are of a comparable nature, 
<li> Encompass all of the languages of the world, 
<li> Clearly document the speech variety that each identifier denotes, 
<li> Maintain and update the system on an on-going basis
<li> Make the system freely and readily accessible to the public over the 
Internet.
</ol>

<p>
Every language description, what is more, always includes information on:

<ol start=6>
<li> The countries the language is spoken in
<li> The alternate names that refer to the language 
<li> The number of speakers of the language
<li> The classification of the language
</ol>

<p>
It is essential to note that the notion of mutual non-intelligibility, listed in criterion 
(1), is fundamental. Varieties of language are only assigned a code if they are 
mutually unintelligible with varieties of any language to which a code has already 
been assigned.  Simply stated,  a dialect whose manifestation is merely 
linguistically idiosyncratic should not normally merit its own code unless speakers 
of other dialects cannot understand it.  

<p>
With reference to criterion (2), it should be noted that the Ethnologue system is 
intended to encompass only those languages of the world in current use. Thus 
the Ge'ez (Ethnologue code GEE) and Sanskrit (Ethnologue code SKT) 
languages both appear in Ethnologue, even though they have not been spoken 
by native speakers for many centuries, simply because they are in common 
liturgical use today.  Akkadian (LINGUIST code XAKK), on the other hand, does 
not appear in the Ethnologue, simply because it has not been used in any 
function for almost 2000 years. 

<p>
Most ancient languages - and many languages which have become extinct over 
the last 500 years - are thus absent from Ethnologue, along, of course, with all 
constructed languages except Esperanto (Ethnologue code ESP), which has a 
small number of native speakers.

<p>
There is one clear inconsistency in this regard in Ethnologue.  Languages which 
are recently extinct often appear there, even when they have no current function.  
The Romance language Dalmatian, for example - spoken on the coast of 
modern Croatia until the late 19th century -  has the Ethnologue code DLM.  On 
the other hand the language Abipon (LINGUIST code XABI), a South American 
Indian language which became extinct at around the same time, does not appear 
in Ethnologue.

<p>
There are also two shortcomings in Ethnologue's system, and these have to do 
with the notions of provenance and  conflict. Every language in Ethnologue is 
documented to a greater or lesser degree.  But we usually do not have a clear 
idea of the evidence upon which it was decided to assign the language a unique 
code.  Nor does the system allow for conflicting language classifications.  For 
example, there is disagreement amongst scholars as to the classification of Low 
German dialects.  This is not indicated in Ethnologue.

<p>
In mitigation of both these points, it might be noted that Ethnologue intends to 
include provenance information in the future, and that Ethnologue is not designed 
to provide a complete classification of the languages to which it assigns codes.  
The classification it does indicate is merely intended to be of service to those 
interested in such information.  

<h2>Criteria for Assigning Codes to Ancient and Constructed languages</h2>

<p>
Since OLAC is designed to allow the categorization of any language, a complete 
set of language codes must be available, a set which includes codes for both 
ancient and constructed languages.   We propose here that the set of 
supplementary codes designed by LINGUIST for this purpose should become the 
OLAC standard, and that the union of these two code sets should be called the 
Universal Language Codes or ULC.  

<p>
This set of supplementary codes should conform as closely as is reasonable to 
the standards set by Ethnologue.   However, to instantiate a useful set of codes 
for ancient and constructed languages entails considerable loosening of the 
Ethnologue standards.  Most importantly, the criterion of mutual intelligibility is 
problematic here for three reasons.  First, in some cases the criterion of mutual 
intelligibility has to be abandoned simply because the language had a cultural 
distinctness, and scholars treat it uniquely.  A case in point is Anglo-Norman, 
which was in reality an aberrant dialect of Old French. However, since it evolved 
independently, and has a literature distinct from that of Old French, which 
scholars treat separately, it must be assigned a distinct code so that work on it 
can be discriminated from work on Old French generally.

<p>
Mutual intelligibility also breaks down in another way.  Ancient languages often 
have a diachronic dimension that can usually be ignored with modern languages.   
Old Latin gave rise to Classical Latin, which in turn gave rise to Late Latin, which 
in turn gave rise to Vulgar Latin or Proto-Romance.  It is likely that no two 
adjacent stages of this complex process would have been mutually 
incomprehensible, had there been any speakers who could speak the two 
versions. How many codes do we assign here on the basis of mutual 
intelligibility?

<p>
There is also the issue of ancient languages in scripts which have as yet not 
been deciphered (e.g. Minoan, the language(s) of Linear A, LINGUIST code 
XMIO), or which cannot be understood, though their texts are written in scripts 
which can be read (e.g. Eteocretan, LINGUIST code XECR).  

<p>
In conclusion then, we propose the following overriding standard for assigning 
codes to ancient languages:

<ol>
<li> Codes should be assigned to ancient languages which are treated 
distinctly by the scholarly community.
</ol>

<p>
In addition, we propose that the following should serve as criteria for the 
assigning of codes:

<ol start=2>
<li> The standard of mutual intelligibility should apply as far as possible.  That 
is, all apparently mutually intelligible ancient languages spoken at 
approximately the same period should be assigned one code, unless it 
conflicts with scholarly usage.  In cases where the level of mutual 
intelligibility cannot be clearly ascertained, separate codes should 
however be assigned.  
<li> Codes should be assigned to undeciphered scripts,  and to uninterpretable 
ancient languages in known scripts.
<li> The system should be as complete as possible.  Ancient languages 
should not be excluded simply because they are obscure. When scholars 
need to refer to a language, distinct codes will be assigned to them, even 
when there is very little information about them.  For example, almost 
nothing is known about Noric (LINGUIST code XNOR) the language 
except that it was spoken in the Roman province of Noricum and was 
Continental Celtic.  It must nevertheless be assigned a code, for Celtic 
scholars sometimes refer to it.
<li> All alternate names of ancient  should be listed, even those which are 
deprecated by scholars, though deprecated names should be clearly 
indicated.  
<li> In order to allow as much integration with Ethnologue codes as possible, 
the primary geographic categorization of ancient languages should be by 
the modern countries in which they once existed.
</ol>

<p>
With regard to constructed languages,  the following standards should apply:

<ol start=7>
<li> Constructed languages cannot be treated by the criterion of mutual 
intelligibility, since they are almost never actually spoken, and are as 
much cultural objects as linguistic.  In some cases there exist variants of 
originally identical constructed languages which have begun evolving 
independently. Esperanto (Ethnologue code ESP) and Ido (LINGUIST 
code CIDO)are instances of this phenomenon.  These should be assigned 
distinct codes.   

<li> No attempt should be made to assign constructed languages to 
geographical regions, since they do not exist in the real world.
</ol>

<h2>Demarcation between Ethnologue and LINGUIST Codes</h2>

<p>
Since we do not believe that any purpose is gained by multiplying language 
codes, we propose that LINGUIST codes should merely fill the gaps in the 
Ethnologue system.  Thus, liturgical languages should remain part of the 
Ethnologue system, even if ancient; and all extinct languages already in 
Ethnologue should remain there.  

<p>
For the future, however, a clear line of demarcation should exist, so that scholars 
will know which organization is responsible for assigning a code they need to a 
language.   We propose that an arbitrary division should be decided on, thus:

<ol start=9>
<li> All languages which require codes and which became extinct before 1800 
should become the responsibility of LINGUIST.   All languages after 1800 
will be in the purview of Ethnologue.
</ol>

<h2>Form of Supplementary Codes</h2>

<p>
To ensure that the LINGUIST codes are always clearly distinguishable from 
those of Ethnologue, and so that codes can be assigned by one organization 
without reference to the other, we further propose a distinction between 
Ethnologue and LINGUIST codes:

<ol start=10>
<li> All codes assigned by LINGUIST will contain four letters, with ancient 
languages having the prefix X (e.g. XAKK Akkadian) and all constructed 
languages the prefix C (e.g. CKLN Klingon).
Documentation of Supplementary Codes
To ensure that the basis upon which codes are assigned is always clear, we 
suggest that:

<li> The documentation of all codes assigned by the supplementary LINGUIST 
system should ultimately include information on their provenance. 

<li> The documentation of each code should ultimately include information as 
to conflicting views of the language and the conflicting subgroupings to 
which it may be assigned.
</ol>
