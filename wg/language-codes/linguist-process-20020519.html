<h2>Making the Code-Set Available</h2>

<p>
The LINGUIST code-set is designed to be a supplement for Ethnologue. This
means that it must be made available in a form which is directly usable by
databases which are using the Ethnologue code-set. Thus the form in which
the code set will be provided will be identical to that used by Ethnologue,
and will mirror the system and tables proposed in Simons [2002], where a
detailed description of the table-structure can be found.  The LINGUIST
code-set will thus be made available in the form of tab-delimited files
whose form mirror exactly those by which Ethnologue disseminates its set.
Three tab-delimited files will be provided.  One will be the LanguageCodes
table, containing the four-letter language code,  the country code, the
language status (containing one of two values, E(xtinct) and C(onstructed))
and the name.  The second will be a LanguageIndex table of alternate names
containing the four-letter language code,  the country code, the name type,
and the name.   The third table to be provided will be the ChangeHistory
table, containing three fields: the affected code, the type of code
(whether C(reated), E(xtended), R(etired), or(U)pdated), the date of the
release, and the description of the change.  

<h2>Facilitating changes and comments on the code-set</h2>

<p>
The set of codes provided by LINGUIST is only as good as the community can
make it.  Furthermore, it is important that the community feel that these
codes are decided by consensus, rather than by fiat. As a result, we will
do all we can to facilitate comments and suggestions on our codes. In
particular: 

<ul>
<li>
LINGUIST and E-MELD language pages will have a link to a form through which
comments can be made and emendations suggested.

<li>
Current suggestions for emendations will be made publicly available on the
LINGUIST website. 
</ul>

<h2>The process by which changes to the code-set can be suggested</h2>

<p>
In order to assure that proposed changes to the code-set can be assessed
and ultimately justified, certain information should provided.  In
particular, proposers must provide the following:

<ul>
<li>Their name
<li>Their affiliation
<li>Their email address, so that feedback can be provided, and an
explanation of the process by which their input will be assessed
<li>A statement justifying the need for the proposed changes
<li>Documentation for the changes proposed
</ul>

<p>
The documentation to be provided must contain either one of the following:

<ul>
<li>References to published work that supports the change
<li>References to unpublished but accessible material that support the code
</ul>

<p>
Once this information is provided, proposers should receive:

<ul>
<li>An explanation of the process that will be used to process the input.
<li>Eventual notification of the eventual outcome of the proposal. 
</ul>

<h2>Processing of the Proposal</h2>

<p>For the purposes of processing proposals for changes to the code-set, a
panel of experts will be set up. This panel will be composed of linguists
who are knowledgeable in different linguistic groupings.  The number of
panelists will vary as needs require it, but will have at least five
members.  Where necessary for coverage, outside experts may be co-opted for
specific tasks.

<p>
For each proposal, one member of the panel will be identified as sponsor,
whose tasks will be to:

<ul>
<li>Announce the proposal to the panel
<li>Request names of suitable external experts
<li>Consult with external experts
<li>Submit a recommendation back to the panel when the process of review is complete.
</ul>

<p>
In the case of disagreement as to a proposal, the decision will be made by
majority vote.  The chair of the panel will have an additional deciding
vote when the vote is evenly split.

<h2>Possible outcomes of the process</h2>

<p>
Proposals for code changes will have four possible outcomes:

<ul>
<li>Release.  In the case of a change being accepted, the change will be queued to be incorporated in the next release of the code-set.
<li>Revise. In the case of a proposal possessing some merit, but needing changes, proposers will be asked to revise their submissions.
<li>Resubmit.  This will take place when a proposal has merit, but needs to be rewritten to explain its case better, or is otherwise misdirected.
<li>Reject:  This will occur when the panel decides that a proposal is without merit.
</ul>

<p>All rejections will be documented, and the reasons for the rejection
made available to for public scrutiny on the LINGUIST and E-MELD
web-sites.
