<H2>1. <A NAME="Creator"></A>Creator vs. Contributor </H2>
<P>If we have roles already why do we separate out contributor and creator and
not just list them as we do all other roles? Is this a way of enforcing that
each item must have a creator and contributor? (Nicholas Thieberger 4-Dec-2007)
</P>
<P>I would like to add my support&#133; If use of Creator is deprecated, as the
guidelines imply, why keep mentioning it? Let's drop it and make sure the
examples for Contributor include obvious 'creators', like 'author' and
'performer'. (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I too am still confused by the distinction between creator and contributor.
Our db distinguishes roles, so we have no easy way to map these. We instead map
all of them to contributor, as in the alternate usage schema. However, in terms
of resource discovery, the is probably not an issue. (Gary Holton 5-Dec-2007)
</P>
<P>[I agree] with Heidi on deprecating &quot;creator&quot; -- at least that is
what we have done at LACITO. Among &quot;contributors&quot; our documents have
a &quot;depositor&quot; and usually a &quot;researcher&quot; (often the same
person) and a &quot;speaker&quot;, etc. (Boyd Michailovsky 10-Dec-2007)</P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluCreator"></A><I>Conclusion: Creator vs. Contributor</I></P>
<P>We seem to have a consensus that the Creator vs. Contributor distinction is
confusing and that our usage notes need to do better at explaining. The DCMI
has also run into this problem. They have not deprecated Creator, so in order
to maintain compatibility with the mainstream, we don't think that we should
either.&#160; However, they have come to the conclusion that Creator is a kind
of Contributor (as indicated in the latest version of the
<A HREF="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</A>,
issued 2008-01-14) and that a vocabulary to refine roles is applicable only to
Contributor (as indicated in the
<A HREF="http://dublincore.org/documents/library-application-profile/">Library
Application Profile</A>). Our usage notes have therefore been revised to permit
<i>olac:role</i> only on Contributor and to explain that Creator should be used only when
   the role vocabulary has no suitable more specific role.  The OLAC-to-Simple-DC
   crosswalk in the OLAC Aggregator will be updated to map Contributor roles like <i>author</i> to a Creator
   element (so as to maintain interoperability with more general metadata standards like
 the
<A
 HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Application_Profile">Eprints
Application Profile</A>).</P>
<H2>2. <A NAME="Relation"></A>Relation</H2>
<P>While a transcript could be considered under some of these refinements
(<I>requires</I>, <I>haspart</I>, <I>hasversion</I>), none of them is specific
enough. As discussed on the Olac-Implementers list in December 2005, could OLAC
extend its metadata to include the following relation pair: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none"> hasTranscript <BR>
IsTranscriptOf </P>
<P> (Nicholas Thieberger 4-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>Let me second Nick's suggestion to add <I>isTranscriptOf</I> and
<I>hasTranscript</I> for Relation. I've been puzzled by their absence for quite
some time. I imagine that there may be a few others relations linguists might
ultimately need, but these two seem like pretty basic and necessary additions
to me right now. (Jeff Good 4-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I third the vote to add <I>hasTranscript</I> and <I>isTranscriptOf</I>. I
doubt most linguists would regard a transcription as a format variant. (Heidi
Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I want to 'fourth' the recommendation that we add <I>hasTranscript</I> and
<I>isTranscriptOf</I>. (Helen Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>I agree with Nick et seqq. on &quot;hasTranscript&quot; and
&quot;isTranscriptOf&quot;. (Boyd Michailovsky 10-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>Also, what relation should be used for annotation files, like interlinear
text? It's not a format variant or a version. The current list of relations was
taken directly from <I>dcterms</I> without, to the best of my recollection, any
review or revision by us. I think we should take this opportunity to revisit
the whole list. We should at least have straightforward terms to characterize
relations among components in a typical language documentation bundle:
recording, annotation, photograph. (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P><I> hasTranscript</I> and <I>isTranscriptOf</I> are definitely needed. I use
these for all types of annotations, whether IT or not. That would include
transcriber, shoebox, and ELAN. Is that not BP? This is the large view of
annotation, where plain-text transcription as simply one point on a continuum.
Perhaps <I>hasAnnotation</I> would be more appropriate? Either way, we
certainly want to distinguish the transcript/annotation from the resource
itself. As Heidi points out, the transcription is not just a format variant.
Indeed, a single resource may have multiple different transcripts by different
creators (er .. contributors). (Gary Holton 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluRelation"></A><I>Conclusion: Relation</I></P>
<P>Agreed that we need the <I>hasTranscript</I> and <I>isTranscriptOf </I>pair.
The trick is how to implement it.&#160; Since these are refinements, we would
be adding to the set of markup elements defined by the DC schema for expressing
qualified Dublin Core in XML (which is what we are following).&#160; To this
point, all of our metadata extensions have been as encoding schemes that are
used in attribute values.&#160; We therefore could not implement this without a
significant departure from the constraints we have followed to this point. The
DCMI is working on a
<A
 HREF="http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCXMLRevision/DCXMLFGuidelines/2006-09-18">major
revision of their guidelines for expressing qualified DC in XML</A> which will
provide an easy way for us to add refinements. Thus we want to hold off and
handle this kind of change in a future round of more radical changes in which
we would align with the DCMI&#146;s new guidelines after they come out. We are
thinking of that as a version 2.0 revision of OLAC metadata. In the meantime,
our immediate goal is a version 1.1 revision which will have minimal
disruption.</P>
<H2>3. <A NAME="Enhancements"></A>Enhancements to Linguistic Type</H2>
<P>Is this the right time to suggest an enhancement of OLAC-linguistic-type to
include more fine-grained details, e.g. Extensive dictionary/ large wordlist/
wordlist Grammatical description/ grammar sketch Making this distinction will
help as we may be looking to establish a documentation index from these
metadata, in order to know that language XXX has YYY amount of information
available about it. (Nicholas Thieberger 4-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>I'm glad he remembered to bring this up, because it's very important. We
should do whatever we can to support the development of a documentation index;
that could turn out to be the single most useful thing OLAC has ever done.
(Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
   <P><A NAME="ConcluEnhancements"></A><I>Conclusion: Enhancements to Linguistic Type</I></P>
<P>Agreed. This will take the form of a new version of the Recommendation on
<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type.html">OLAC Linguistic Data
Type Vocabulary</A>. That is too extensive a change for version 1.1, and so we
are listing that among the goals of version 2.0. </P>
<H2>4. <A NAME="Granularity"></A>Granularity Recommendation</H2>
<P>I would like to see recommendation on the so-called &quot;granularity&quot;
issue. That is, from OLAC's perspective, what is the appropriate unit on which
a metadata record should be based. From Rosetta's perspective (whose OAI server
has been defunct for a while, and for that my apologies), for example, our own
worldview is that our database consists of language nodes with resources
attached. However, I think the general OLAC worldview is that the world
consists of linguistic resources. Rosetta can serve metadata on our worldview
or OLAC's, and I don't have any strong feelings about this. But, I would like
to see an OLAC recommendation on this topic. (To bring up another example, is
an IMDI session the appropriate thing to expose to OLAC? Or should it be the
more fine-grained components of the session? I imagine the corpus is too big.)
(Jeff Good 4-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I would like to see that, too. There was talk, once upon a time, of
returning data at some kind of 'collection' level, but I don't remember any
resolution on this issue. As AILLA's collection grows, I can clearly see that
it would be more useful to searchers to retrieve summaries of collections than
scores of repetitive results for individual files. (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007) 
</P>
<P>There are three levels: the file, the bundle (IMDI session), and the
collection (e.g. the Joel Sherzer Kuna language collection.) Can't there be a
way for users or archives to specify which level they want to expose? (Heidi
Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I second Jeff's comments--especially the suggestion that the usage document
discuss suggested granularity.&#160; We have found that this is the most
difficult decision that anyone has to make (whether archive or individual) when
attempting to describe their collection.&#160; We tell individual linguists
(who don't want to write too many metadata descriptions) to simply list a
corpus of documentation treating a single language as a single resource.&#160;
On the other hand, this procedure leaves IMDI listed as having only 15 (?)
resources.&#160; Guidance would be helpful. (Helen Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>Regarding the granularity issue, I seem to recall us batting this around
quite a bit in early OLAC discussions, with no general consensus. Archivists
relentlessly complain to me that we language folks are too granular. Some have
suggested that there should be just 20 items in the ANLC archive -- one for
each language! Well, that's a bit extreme, but collections are useful. ANLC
maintains a subcollection field which is useful for searching. This is often a
donor, say Irene Reed or Knut Bergsland. Materials within those subcollections
also show up in subject.language searches, of course, but often the
subcollection is of interest. Indeed, this is the classic type of organization
for traditional archives. Other subcollections identify funded projects, or
particular speakers.&#160; Maybe this is an archive-internal issue and not one
which is relevant to resource discovery. However, as Heidi points out, it would
be useful OLAC service providers to be able to offer more or less granular
search opportunities, so that users could have the option of not having to wade
through hundreds of very closely related records. (Gary Holton 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>Certainly it would be nice to be able to access metadata by collection.
(Boyd Michailovsky 10-December-2007)</P>
<P>The granularity issue is addressed in section 6, &#147;Guidelines concerning
relevance and granularity&#148; of our Standard,
<A HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.html">OLAC
Repositories</A>. It points out that too fine a level of granularity degrades
the signal-to-noise ratio in searching and that this is legitimate grounds for
rejecting the registration application of a repository. It specifically says
that creating a separate record for each file that makes up the documentation
of a single speech event is not appropriate.&#160; Going to the other extreme
of having a single record to describe an entire collection is in fact
considered good practice at the resource discovery level, since the thing
people will be using OLAC search for is primarily to discover the existence of
the corpus, rather than to select individual items from within the
corpus.&#160; The latter is typically done after entering the corpus. (Gary
Simons 14-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I agree with the intuition that 500 [records for individual files in a
corpus] is too many, but one seems like too few. Under a scenario where I'm
looking for anything on language X, this might seem reasonable but what if, for
example, I'm looking for extensive materials from some particular genre. Then,
I would want those 500 texts broken down by genre and I would want to have them
all bunched together. I don't know what the right balance is here, but this
strikes me as shifting the balance too much towards the language-based search.
But, I wonder what people who run big archives think about this. ... Something
I would find useful here is specific recommendations for mapping records using
the IMDI session-corpus model to the OLAC model. </P>
<P>... To sum up, I wonder if somewhere there shouldn't be (i) an enumeration
of representative example search scenarios for the data and service provider to
consult as a kind of &quot;cheat sheet&quot; guiding them as to how to approach
granularity, (ii) a discussion of what the canonical service provider is in the
OLAC context, and (iii) a discussion of what kinds of records a service
provider should expect from a data provider. (Jeff Good 16-Dec-2007)</P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluGranularity"></A><I>Conclusion: Granularity
Recommendation</I></P>
<P>This issue is clearly relevant for OLAC Metadata Usage Guidelines. We have
added a new section to the document on &#147;<A
HREF="http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html#Granularity%20of%20resources">Granularity
of Resources</A>.&#148;</P>
<H2>5. <A NAME="SubjectLanguage"></A>Element Content of Subject Language</H2>
<P>Should we try to come up with some way of specifying how to interpret the
element content of Subject Language when it's there? Right now, two use cases
are given: (i) dialect and (ii) alternate name. Since these two cases are so
common and have very different semantics, shouldn't there be an (optional) way
of specifying what that element content means? It shouldn't be too hard to come
up with a way of expressing this. (Jeff Good 4-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>I would like to add my support&#133; (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007) </P>
<P STYLE="margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none"> &quot;For a work of literature
or other monolingual document aimed at the speakers of a particular language,
use Language to identify that language. ... For an annotated text, use Language
for the language in which the annotations are made; use Subject.language for
the language of the base text that is being annotated.&quot;</P>
<P>This is clear.&#160; But, concerning text documents (and not text embedded
in a language description), it seems odd to list an annotated text under the
language of annotation and the same text unannotated under its own language.
Could this cause users searching across OLAC and other documents to fail to
find texts in a language they are interested in? Would it not be better to
explicitly distinguish annotation language from source text language and to
code both right here under DC &quot;Language&quot;, which is the first place a
user would look?&#160; We can maintain our convention (professional
deformation?) of&#160; considering the &quot;Subject&quot; -- specifically
&quot;Subject.language&quot; -- of a text to be the language it is in -- after
all, OLAC is primarily for linguists, and languages are our subject.&#160; (I
recognize that this means having the same information in two places for this
type of resource. This is bad, but maybe not too bad if it improves access to
our documents.) (Boyd Michailovsky 10-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>We want to show people how to add narrowing or clarifying notes about
specific language varieties. I get this sort of note often at AILLA - people
will pick the closest ISO code, but add a note explaining how the code is quite
right. We all know the codes need to be revised, but that will take a long
time. It is good for people to make these notes a part of their OLAC records,
though, both to encourage their colleagues to think about them and so that code
revisers can find them. Maybe something like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&#160;&#160;&lt;dc:subject xsi:type=&quot;olac:ISO639-3&quot; olac:code=&quot;zab&quot;&gt;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec. Ethnologue designation: San Juan Guelav&iacute;a 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Zapotec (zab), but this includes many varieties, including Tlacolula de 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Matamoros Zapotec. Also known as: Valley Zapotec, Tlacolula Valley Zapotec, 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; but these names also include other language varieties.
&#160;&#160;&lt;/dc:subject&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The note is one that Brook Danielle Lillehaugen, one of my model depositors,
pastes into every metadata form. (Heidi Johnson 8-Jan-2008) </P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluSubjectLanguage"></A><I>Conclusion: Element Content of
Subject Language</I></P>
<P>There are two different issues here.&#160; The first regards clarifying the nature of
   the text content. The first comment points out that there are two main uses of the text
   content (for an alternate
   name or for a variety name) and asks if there should be a way to distinguish these
   two cases. This can be done by means of the wording of the text content; the
   most straightforward approach is to add the word "dialect" after the name in the case
   of a variety name.  An example like this is given in the document.
   Other cases of indicating a variety, such as "Women's speech,"
   don't involve a name at all and so do not pose a problem.  Still other cases of using
   the content (like the note that Heidi Johnson gives above as an example)
   can include multiple names, including both alternate names and variety
   names.
</P>
<P>The second issue has to do with when to identify a language with Language versus
    with Subject. The usage note for Language has been substantially expanded to clarify
    various cases. </P>
<H2>6. <A NAME="SubjLginLangAttribute"></A>Reference to Subject Language in
xml:lang Attribute</H2>
<P>In the opening discussion of practices that apply to all elements, the
<I>xml:lang</I> attribute is discussed without any reference to Subject
Language.&#160; I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to distinguish the two
immediately, if only in a parentheses. (Helen Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007) </P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluSubjLginLangAttribute"></A><I>Conclusion: Reference to
Subject Language in Lang Attribute</I></P>
<P>Agreed.&#160; Both Language and Subject are now mentioned in the discussion
of <I>xml:lang</I> in order to distinguish the three places in which language
codes can be used.</P>
<H2>7. <A NAME="Coverage"></A>Coverage</H2>
<P>I was pleased to see the emphasis on geographical coverage in the usage
notes.&#160; But--from working with LL-MAP, I have several questions with
regard to the following paragraph under 'Coverage': </P>
<P STYLE="margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none"> &quot;In the OLAC context,
service providers already have a database that maps languages to the countries
in which they are spoken [OLAC-Language]. Coverage should not be used to
duplicate this information; rather service providers will support searches
concerning languages spoken in a given country by referring to the language
database. Coverage should be used geographically only when the language
involved has a wide distribution and the resource focuses on its use in a
particular region or geopolitical jurisdiction, or conversely, when the
resource deals with a topic of study in which the region itself is in focus,
e.g., multilingualism, language polilcy, languages in contact, in a given
locale.&quot; </P>
<P>Isn't the phrasing of this recommendation rather too restrictive?&#160; It
seems to enforce use of the Ethnologue/GMI polygons to identify language
locales and to discourage collection of any other language locale data. LL (and
LL-MAP) do in fact use these polygons and language/country match-ups.&#160; But
do we want the OLAC usage guidelines to suggest that this is what all service
providers should do?&#160; What would be the consequences of such
standardization?&#160; And even if service providers do want to construct their
services around a standard set of language locales, what would be the harm in
collecting more specific information from archives and individuals?&#160;
Perhaps we need to discuss this before deciding one way or another. (Helen
Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I agree with Helen's reservations about relying on Ethnologue for coverage
information on specific documents. (Boyd Michailovsky 10-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>The examples in this section don't seem parallel; the second two leave out
the Subject element.&#160; A small point, but in a usage document the examples
should probably be as clear and complete as possible. (Helen Aristar-Dry
5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>A good example illustrated the difference between coverage and the place
created is a map of Mexico (what is covered) that was produced in California
(not coverage). (Heidi Johnson 8-Jan-2008)</P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluCoverage"></A><I>Conclusion: Coverage</I></P>
<P>We agree with Helen&#146;s comments and have removed the mention of service
providers making inferences based on known language-to-country mappings.&#160;
We have also expanded the examples to include more elements.</P>
<H2>8. <A NAME="Place"></A>Proposal for Place Element</H2>
<P>There is no obvious way to specify the place where a resource was created.
People have told me to use Coverage for this, but first, it's a completely
non-transparent interpretation of the term, and second, the guidelines
specifically state that Coverage pertains to the intellectual content of the
resource:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none"> &quot;Definition: The spatial
or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource,
or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.&quot; </P>
<P>We should either add a Place element that is parallel in every way to the
Date element, or change the definition of Coverage to include this
counter-intuitive usage with supporting examples. (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007) 
</P>
<P>This gap exposes the publication bias of Dublin Core. Nobody cares where a
journal article is written, but we do very much care where field recordings are
made. Collecting Zapotec vocabulary in Los Angeles is quite different from
collecting it in Oaxaca. If we're going to recommend OLAC elements as an
adequate basic-level documentation of resources, we have to include all the
essential data points. (Heidi Johnson 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>A side-question:&#160; What about the collection point of a piece of
documentation?&#160; This isn't &quot;coverage&quot; in the sense of what the
subject covers, but it's something we would very much want to know, and
sometimes the distinction between subject and collection point blurs (e.g., for
Arienne's collection of Mon La songs, where the collection point is part of a
map layer whose 'subject' is places where this ceremonial type persists).&#160;
Is there a place in the OLAC metadata to record the geographic coordinates of
the place where a song was collected?&#160; Should it be mentioned here, if
only as a parentheses?&#160; (I think that cross referencing to emphasize
distinctions is helpful to the user, cf. the reference to &quot;Date&quot; as
distinguished from temporal coverage.) (Helen Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>Interesting that we both thought of the collection point problem:&#160;
point of collection doesn't seem to go in 'Coverage' but we do want to know
it.&#160; Where should it be indicated? (Helen Aristar-Dry 5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I also want to second Heidi's point about Location. We currently map this to
OLAC Description, but that's not a very satisfactory solution. Location can be
extremely important in sorting out issues such as dialect variation. But an
even more important use of this element is for distinguishing displaced
language resources, as Heidi points out about Zapotec in Los Angeles. (Although
perhaps Zapotec in Paris would be clearer -- there may actually be some Zapotec
speaking communities in LA.) The point is that we need a way to exclude these
displaced field methods recordings from the search. Coverage does not work
because Heidi's Zapotec example still has Oaxaca as its Coverage. (Gary Holton
5-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>I agree with Heidi that place of recording is important, and that it clearly
does not belong in the coverage category as defined. But I would keep
&quot;coverage&quot; as it is. A &quot;Place&quot; category parallel to the
&quot;Date&quot; category would work, but it would mean a new DC
category.&#160; That leaves &quot;Description&quot; (Gary).&#160; This is
currently used for free-text information, but could it be stretched to include
an OLAC extension for place of recording? (Boyd Michailovsky 10-Dec-2007) </P>
<P>As the DC definitions say, Coverage is for &quot;the spatial or temporal
topic of what the resource.&quot;.&#160; Thus, when the value is a geocode
(like the geospatial coordinates), it is saying that the resource is
&#147;about&#148; (in some sense) that place on earth.&#160; When the resource
is an example of how they talk in that place, then I think that using a geocode
as the value of Coverage is completely appropriate.&#160; When the place where
the resource was collected also happens to be the place where people talk that
way, then the Coverage coincides with the place of collection, and since this
is the default case, it does not seem necessary to specifically talk about
point of collection in the descriptive metadata.</P>
<P>But consider the exceptional case, in which a lifelong resident of X, where
an endangered language is spoken, flies to a far away place Y where recordings
are made of that language.&#160; The Coverage should still be reported as
location X, but in this case the collection point is location Y .&#160; People
who want to find the resource are going to be looking for X, not Y, which is
why Coverage should be X.&#160; If the cataloger felt it was necessary to say
something about the circumstances of the recording event (including where it
took place).&#160; That would fall under the umbrella of the Description
element.&#160; But for the purpose of resource discovery, the record would not
even need to mention the collection point.&#160; It would be sufficient for
this fact to be documented inside the resource, such as in an introduction to
the corpus, in much the same way that an author uses the Preface to explain
where the book was written. Thus, I think the answer for this issue is to
include some discussion like the above in the usage notes for Coverage. (Gary
Simons 14-Dec-2007)</P>
<P>There needs to be an example of using the Description field for the Place
Created data, in the cases where that's relevant (e.g. recordings.) Or could we
get an extension of Description for this? (Heidi Johnson 8-Jan-2008) </P>
<P><A NAME="ConcluPlace"></A><I>Conclusion: Proposal for Place Element</I></P>
<P>We have added to the usage notes for Coverage to explain how it relates to
point of collection, and how Description can be used to add location-related
details that do not relate to spatial topic.</P>
